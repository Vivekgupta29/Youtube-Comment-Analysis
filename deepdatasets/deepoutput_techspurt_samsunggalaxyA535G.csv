,"Thanks for checking out this unboxing, my SIM's already in the A53, full review coming next week! So what do you reckon? Diamond or dud?"
Daphne Baje,"Dang that performance test was really dissappointing for Samsung. If they're gonna bust out a new midrange to replace a great previous gen, they should always maintain/upgrade. Never downgrade!"
Mushrif Ahmed,"I went for the A52s 5G. Because compared to the A53, the A52s has a better Processor, a headphone jack, and it comes with a charging brick. They're both the same price (in my country). So the A52s is clearly the better option in my opinion."
Badr Khiyat,"When I first heard about the A53 5G, I considered upgrading. But when I heard it would feature an Exynos processor, I went for the more affordable and more capable A52s 5G."
Nicky Janssen,"Thx for the review! I recently went for the A52s 5G. Seemed a much better deal to me. Only thing the A53 has going for it, is the longer software support... Not really an upgrade worth the extra $ IMHO (CPU wise even a downgrade = WTF Samsung?)."
pshnd,I got a Samsung Galaxy A52s 5G thanks to your review and now I'm looking and this and can't hide the feeling that this is kind of a downgrade.
Mary Mitchell-Stewart,"Actually just ordered this one. My first Samsung! I'm excited! Love your personality and video! While many are implying this isn't the best Samsung, for my first Samsung it definitely seems decent!"
Quentin TAURIAC,I feel like all smartphones released in 2022 are less powerful than previous generation. Kinda disappointing tho :/
wcked,"Samsung trolls apple for removing headphone jack, charger from the box and then do the same. It's a shame they don't provide a charger with a mid ranger."
Sigmaster40,"Just acquired an A52S 5G. Using it for several days and very happy. Much better than my A50, which was a great phone, but slow response at times, which was getting irritating. My new phone has a head phone jack, which is the main reason I did not bother with the s21 or s22. I use the jack daily at work. The smaller display size of the  s21/s22 and price were also a good reason not to buy. "
M M IRL,"THIS IS A GREAT PHONE BUT HAS MANY PROBLEMS: I returned it back to Amazon due to defects after having and using it for less than week: 1) the charging port would not hold the charging cord plug after a 3 days. The port wore out. I tried many different cords and brands but the port is a low quality design/build. 2) 120 hertz frequently freezes bc the processor is not fast enough to handle the speeds especially if using a high speed internet signal/connection. 3) there is no haptic touch using google phone app even though there is a setting for it. Touch dialpad sound works but again not haptic. 4) speakerphone is too low (volume control is no help) to hear outside. Inside a room, speakerphone is adequate but not outside. However, media speakers are loud inside and outside, for example watching YouTube vids. The only good or great thing about the phone is the battery life and screen quality resolution. Absolutely,  not worth $450. Even at  close to or just under $300 I would not buy it. $200 maybe. So Buyer Beware. FYI, I wrote the same review on Amazon (verified buyers) as I have written here."
Arnas Danusas,"Thanks for the review! Been looking to upgrade for a while, and am torn between the Pixel 6 and the A53, which one would you recommend? My priorities are battery life and a good camera."
Neehal,"Hey, great video! I saw in a review that there's frame rate drops from 120Hz mode in general use and feels a bit laggy. Was is the same for your case?"
CB21,"Hi Chris,
Lovely video. However, I would like to request you make a video about a comparison between A53 and S21 FE. Even just your recommendation is appreciated as both the phones are on the affordable range. Thank you!"
Vanida Kotimanusvanij,"I have the Samsung a52 for 2 years and I love the camera. Quality is great. A lot better than my iphone 7 plus I had, camera sucked."
Andrew Marshall,"That Exynos 1280 is a deal breaker, its a big downgrade on last year's model. Much better deals than this around"
Kent,"I appreciate you Tech Spurt. Your videos are informative as always, and very helpful.

Greetings from Sweden."
Wyatt Partridge,"Kicking it with a Galaxy S20+ with 12GB RAM, Snapdragon 865, Micro SD support. Never happier. Nearly no compromises, downgrades or questionable feature omissions (other than the 3.5mm headphone jack RIP)"
Rich L,I love this phone got it today as my second phone my main is a iphone 13 pro max and this samsung is great to me tbh
Ishmaam Sha-Riyad Imam,Waiting for the galaxy a73 review. Hopefully this is gonna be my next device after my Honor 8x
Donald Meyer,Amazing video! I am waiting for the a73 though. I love your tech videos on new phones. You are an inspiration to me.
shaheed Mustafa,Thanks for today's review can't wait for the in-depth review thanks again
Zep437,Bottom line: go w the A52 S. Thank you for the useful review!
KingKen04,I have the A52S and I think I’ll stick it with for now. The 53 seems decent but I think I’ll wait and upgrade to a z flip or something
sharkface,I would 100% choose an a52s over this (mainly because I'm watching on one lmao)
Mario Petrillo,"Nice video, i also went for the a52s for 290 EUR, perform very well. This new exynos 1280 needs serious optimization, compared to snap 778G the exynos is slower. A question if you can reply, where i can find the beautiful wallpapers you use in all your videos? Thanks"
The Everyday Driver,"While I love me some premium wired headphones, I really don't see much of a perk anymore. Wireless tech has come really far from when I last asked the question with my LGV20 in 2016. Sitting on a tran-atlantic flight isn't a hindrance with wireless these days"
ialeixo84,I'd still recommend the A52s over this one.
Fredrick Oywer,Surely they knew the headphone jack is a big deal for this A50 series. Hopefully they'll listen and bring it back for the A54
lifeisillusion,"Thanks for the information. Very helpful. Just got myself one, not because I want a new  but I broke the screen on my A70 BAD! since I have an additional SD card in my A70,is there a slot for this in A53?"
R P,"Hi really enjoy your vids, very down to earth. Can I ask a question, I’m new to android and have decided to migrate over from iOS. I have just purchased this phone, I  see there’s a general consensus that it’s not much of an upgrade from the a52, having never had that phone, will I still find it a good performing phone. Also coming from an iPhone XR. Cheers mate also not using it from gaming, just day to day activities"
TheLifetraveler1,"I sent back a Samsung Galaxy a52s, last week, when I heard you announce the Samsung Galaxy a53.  I've had the a53 for a few days and here is the good and the bad.  Yes, I miss having a headphone jack.  Surprisingly the geekbench 5 test show the processor in the a53 is actually slower than the processor in the a52s.  But faster than the Nord 10 phone that I had before.  Samsung needs to stick with Qualcomm processors.  Battery life also disappointing compared to the Moto g power up phones I had before which would easily class 3 days. On this a53 if I make it through the day it's just about right. I've actually reduced the refresh speed to 60 hertz, and that improves the battery.  Good thing, the screen is bright..  Even better when working on the T-Mobile 5G network this phone is achieving 300 MB download speed, compared to my Moto g5g, and nord 10 phones, only achieving about 50 megabits download speed."
Flávio da Silva,"I was thinking in the A53 but with the performance being lower than the A52, ill get a A52 instead."
lone wanderer,With this being a replacement for the A52 and not the A52-S i wonder if they will launch a A53-S later in the year.
FHF Masti,I Love the new one 
Aaron Law,Was debating this for my mum but perhaps get the 52s instead!
Mustafa Pop25,"So happy that stereo speakers made it to midrangers
Finally i can consider a midrange tbh"
磷酸Dream,"The exynos 1280 is weaker than the Snapdragon 778G, get the A52s if you can"
Jerry Obura,"Ah, the A 53, I regard the the 50s range of Samsung as the benchmark for a years basic technological must have and you spent your own money to bring us this review, man, you are a saint, thanks (£400 is not a small sum especially when you already have hundreds of phones beging for your sim) I wish I could send you a bottle of Ugandan brew but he'll it is what it is thanks though."
Matthew Koschara,"Thanks! My wife has the new Samsung S22 Ultra, but I'm thinking I'd like something different (And more affordable)."
Grace Levy,"This may be a silly question as I am really not tech savvy, but does the second sim slot literally mean I can put two sims in that I could swap between? I am planning on going travelling around a few different countries and it would be really helpful as I am going to be using sims bought over there and would like to keep hold of the ones I buy to use again in case I return! Or is it just for added memory/storage?"
Miracle Winchester,The camera bump slope looks so good
Dariusz Tech,Very disappointing and huge downgrade over the a52s. I did camera comparison and a52s did better than a53
NIJIL PC,വളരെ നല്ല അവതരണം .well explained.
Hossein Adib,"In the Samsung phone video, please show all quick setting toggles by tapping on the plus icon in the quick setting panel. thanks a lot."
Marinus,"Wait, focal pickup on the front camera? Do you mean it does have autofocus? Because the S21 FE doesn't even have focus on the front camera. That would be something."
Tsvetomir Stephanov,"Thanks for the review ... Going for ""Awesome Peach"" :) ... Have a great day ... Deffinetely helped in the ""family"" choice we've had here :) ..."
DJ - SUPA G,I'll opt for the A52s 5g instead all around better phone
Jack priddle,"I've just purchased a A53.. I placed a preorder for the  release date of the 1st but got it some 7 day before.. not sure why. 

It's a good phone for the price especially when samsung  are currently are offering enhanced trade in.. got £110 off for a cracked Huawei p20. "
Ben Chua,"just a question, does the a53 have wifi 6 capabilities?"
kevin jones,You’ll have to do a A52S 5g v A53 5g comparison. Is the 53 worth the extra beer  tokens over the A52S ? 
jason pierce,"I wouldn't bother with this handset in my opinion if you are in this price range I'd fully recommend the one plus Nord 2 5g 
I've really enjoyed this handset from day one and it feels like a much more expensive handset"
Viper Hadi,"Watching this video on my Samsung A52s...
I'm totally satisfied..."
Simply Clean,Whats better a53 or s22 ultra
Alaa Fadel,"I bought the A52s after watching your videos n reviews about it, I can say I have made the right decision."
Saeglopur89,"I have it already 2,5 week and it's perfect. Now just waiting for Ringke Onyx case :)"
RIP,"Can u test the ""Aralon forge and flame 3d"" in the next video ? :D"
ABDUL HAI 64,Beautiful display
Veritas Vincit,"Weak processor and no charger mean I won't be buying this device although it ticks all the remaining boxes for me. Currently on OP7 Pro. Not a gamer. Battery life/fast charging and multimedia experience matter more to me. Will get the Realme X7 Max instead. 4 years software update seemed too nice to pass on initially, but then it turns out I've only kept my previous devices for 2 years then change them, so what good do 4 Android updates do me? Taking out the charger for ""environmental reasons"" is just corporate speak for more profit which pissed me off even more. Thanks, but I'll get a device from a brand that doesn't take its customers for tools."
uarryyy,I'm skeptical for A53 with Snapdragon 695
Theodore Tekkers,Looks pretty cool.
Tony.33,"""who ever that invented this fun mode, I hate you with every single cells in my body""  I'm dead"
MegaMug,I love this phone. It replaced my Nokia 7.2.
I W Barr,"Would love a budget phone round up for GAMERS please.
Don't know if you have seen how many 'AAA' titles are coming to Mobile.
Warzone , Apex , R6S and many more."
Zaid benriane,do you know when will the a53s version come out ? and great video as always.
garreswe,"People shouldn't complain so much about the bloatware. I'm sure that helps reduce the phone price, similar to watching TV with ads. Also it's super easy to remove or hide the apps so you don't have to suffer if you don't like them."
Siraj_jr_,03:17 man I love how blunt this guy is.
Prince,I will wait for the Poco F4.
Craig Collins,At least you don't get the boring black if you buy it yourself 
Am check,Downgrade is the new upgrade
Matt Sanchez,Now if you could just put the Apple phone processor in this phone!  Also amazing what Samsung can build for $400 vs the shite  (Chris’s words) Apple builds for the same amount…and I’ll bet Apple makes ten times more profit
Tlielt Huddab,"WTH have you done with the background music? It's like a bunch of horny weasels are trying to escape the paper bag you put them in!

Otherwise a great first experience take (as per usual). Seems my hunch that the A52s was a much better buy (currently at €300). Just saying: ""Get one while you still can!"" (If you have the need, and the money of course...)"
ABDUL HAI 64,I will be waiting for your review full review
Monty Gill,I think the upcoming Poco F4 will blow this out of the water.
Joel M,"Thanks for the review , wireless charging?"

stewie griffin,What’s best 5g at 500$ range
EJ,I can only afford midrange phones. I would really like to buy a Samsung device but compare to Xiaomi I can get better specs and features for the same price.
3rd Street Menace⚜️,This will probably be my next phone after i upgrade from the 2021 Moto G power.
Conrad Bo,Good video and review
Cin,Midrange phone with no charger and headphone jack bugger off Samsung
ABDUL HAI 64,778 G A52s is much better than 1280
Hock Sing Ng,The problem with A53 - we can get the A52S for the same price...even slightly cheaper...
Peter Das,"Sir can you please make a unboxing for Realme 9 pro 5g
I know it's a month old but it's a request
Nobody has made a proper unboxing for it
I will be highly obliged if you do so "
RebelRedRollo,I have an A52 5G and am probably sticking with it until I can be arsed to switch to Pixel...
Sattar Khan,Wonderful
Jogie Glen Mait,It's a pass for me on this one.
Soto-Tek,The 4K video stabilization is pretty bad like on the A52 and A52 5G. Samsung Music is also a mess on mine.
Nakazul,The day i got my first Samsung phone in years! (A52s 5G) the 53 came on as new release and commercial. Bummed out how it seems the companies is just churning out new phones and my phone is now obsolete. I still got my beloves headphone jack that seems missing.... going to shut up and watch the video now

DerSol,"0 upgrades from the A52s, just a crappy exynos and no headphone jack and no charger in the box of a budget phone, but who cares Samsung fans will buy it anyways."
Eric Braun,"Smartthings can do quite a bit more than Google Home, though the best workup is hooking up devices in smartthings and then hooking smartthings to Google Home."
ABDUL HAI 64,But sumsung should encloud charger in the box 
branko tomasović,I buy to my wife a53 and she is very happy with him. And that's the only thing that is important.

Mark B,A couple of years ago this would of been a flagship phone  but today it’s a mid tier phone. So what’s the point of buying today’s flagship phones?
E,3:12 i repeated this part 3 times hahaha
Kuri Cosmos,I still use Outlook xD I like it more than google's offerings.
ryanftw,"Honestly, this one is pretty disappointing from Samsung… I just got my mom a brand new A52S 5G, a case, screen protectors, and a super fast charger for a little bit less than the retail price for the A53. And the A53 isn’t even better. You lose performance, you lose the headphone Jack, and if I can remember right, you lose the micro sd card slot too… The A52S is faster too. It will probably handle future updates better than the A53. Honestly I don’t know who this phone is really for…"
Yusuf Ibrahim,Thanks for the videos

My brain is banging around like a set of donkey balls during a gallop.
I am due to upgrade this month and I am not sure where to go. A52s, S21Fe or A53. I am not necessarily a gamer but more for video making and photos. Your awesome reviews are great but any further pointers bang them this way "
A.Vedant Raj,This is what I want!
Abdullah_MUI,From where do you get these wallpapers
Prismarine Man CS,Awsome !
Paul Mcgeever,It's scandalous that samsung omit the charger. They don't even state it on their website. Just bought one and not even the retailer advised me i would need to buy a charger. Spoke with samsung and they denied it saying it is disclosed on their website and that their official retailers do make customers aware.  They did tell me that i must buy their own charger as using an aftermarket one even it meets their specs will void any warranty claim for a battery related issue. Buyer beware of using your existing charger  and shame on you samsung for extracting money out of me just to use the phone.
Allen Game,A52 5G re released without a charger and audio jack XD

POLΛRIS,I don’t get it its a midrange phone and people who buy it dont have the same needs as ones who buy flagships i mean removing the jack and charger is ridiculous.. plus this years version is literally a downgrade from the A52s.. Samsung is getting worse with each passing year
