Paul Styke,The hype surrounding this movie as it approached opening night was so surreal to me. Saw the trailer and saw it opening night. The atmosphere and energy in the theater is unlikely to be matched within the MCU again. We spent years watching these heros get to this point and after the movie man we were exhausted after that ending. I mean that in the best way because we had no idea what to expect next. It was a good cliffhanger

Looking back on it, it’s just another scene in the saga, but seeing it happen in theaters for the first time on opening night, that’s when everyone knew the next movie would be crazy (remember, at the time, endgame was called infinity war part 2) since everyone knew the story would be ending there, but didn’t except all the infinity stones to be together till the second movie. All people talked about after the movie was just excitement for the next one."

vishnu menon,This is the best marvel movie till date and I will always love this movie.Even though end game is nostalgic and gives goosebumps this movie is miles above end game just because of the story build up for 10 years and Thanos having the perfect hero / villain character which was why he stole the show throughout the movie.This was the Thanos I expected to see in endgame as well but he was completely different Thanos from infinity war and that put me a little off but this movie is the heart of the avengers.

I seriously can't understand how people watched this masterpiece of a movie and think the new spiderman is better? Now that u know when the spiderman arrive will u enjoy it again nearly as much? No. But with infinity war I come back to it as my top 2 movies of all time with Interstellar. Masterpieces the both of them. Thanos lost in only one timeline and in rhat same timeline the multiverse opens. I'm sorry but I can't get over how trash the plot of spiderman was. First 1hr 45mins of clearing his image and making cures for the villains? How is that compared to what happened in this movie. It acc hurts me that people think like this 😔
