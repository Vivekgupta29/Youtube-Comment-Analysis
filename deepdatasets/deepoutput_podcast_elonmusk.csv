Cindy M.,Two highly intelligent genius gentlemen. Such a super conversation! I‚Äôve been watching both of your channels for a long time. Take good care and Have a Beautiful Weekend!!!Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
,I find most interviews with Elon incredibly frustrating. Just shallow questions that don‚Äôt really do the man‚Äôs mind justice. This was great. Good job Lex.
SAM ARKOH FIT,The way Elon Described how the human brain works when driving is absolutely insane . Those vivid visual details . Painting everything and how amazing the brain is .
COLLINS KIPROTICH,It's incredibly hard to interview Elon man .That was the greatest interview ever .You deserve a Medal of Freedom Lex
exileinrosedale,"Lex - You have become my FAVORITE Interviewer EVER! Excellent work on shooting from the hip, challenging Elon like I have never seen or heard. God Bless you and thank you for YOUR hard work!"
Chris Dock,"""If there's something that goes wrong with the vehicle, it's fundamentally my fault."" That's what leadership looks like. Elon has his flaws, but that right there is why he has had success in solving so many hard problems."
Path Finder,I love how Elon really tries to find a way with his wording to make our monkey brains comprehend what he is trying to say
T C,Lex and Elon for two and a half hours. Dreams do come true!
Will Thomas,Finally someone who's smart asking good questions for an interview with him

Morten Stjernholm,"This is just the best questions ever asked to musk.  Lee, you are amazing! Your undestanding,   empathy and general intelligence shows!   you"
Keith Remedy,"Dare I say that this is easily Elon‚Äôs best interview by far. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that it‚Äôs Lex on the other side of the table. Lex, you are getting better & better at this too"
Brenden,"I respect and appreciate Elons moments of pause to think and respond the way he wants, but damn there‚Äôs so many times I thought the podcast froze Ô∏è"
Kimberly Rasco Orsak,One of my favorite Elon interviews... 
Federico Galimberti,A super interview. I have understood a lot more about Elon as a scientist/ entrepreneur than in in many other podcasts

David Babin,Such an insightful podcast filled with so much knowledge. Very well done overall Lex this is best podcast I've heard yet.

We need more of that."
Danny O'Brien,"Thanks Lex, great interview. Cheers to Elon for coming on too!"
Reinaldo Viccini Gutierrez,A window into the mind of Elon Musk. Amazing.
sirfer6969,1:59:00 the shout out to Tim Dodd at Everyday Astronaut was probably the coolest part of the podcast in terms of benefiting others. Lex and Elon for president and VP of the world
native flower pot,You guys make me love physics more and more. Ô∏è
xDespo,"I started to hear Elon with JRE podcast and I was amazed, and alhtough I really love JRE podcast, this one has a different atmoshpere, it goes deeper in technique and concepts, I love it, itwer is awesome too, I subbed"
,30 seconds in and I know this is gonna be a great episode. Thanks Lex!!!
Tracy Sparks,"I usually listen to podcasts while I am making my jewelry, but I cannot do that with yours. I find myself wanting to watch, to really listen very carefully, (I am very visual). This conversation was so enthralling and I actually understood most of it. I really appreciate how you approach your guests and that you give them the time they need to form the answers. It is refreshing!"
Murali,"Thanks Lex. Awesome podcast. The questions are great and inspiring, motivating. The answers from elon musk are amazing. I love this podcast. thanks for doing this."
Dig,Thumbs up and subscribed! Incredible interview with one of the finest minds on earth! Questions that Mr Musk is willing to answer without giving anything away. Hearing his thought process is a privilege! Just off the top of his head!
Michael Fargo,"Thanks for the interview.  Great interaction between the two of you.  I've watched this video a few times.  It still makes me think. 
  Another way of saying what Elon iterates is: thinking simple is hard.  Getting down to the component parts of a process to understand it in its simplicity is not simple.  I wrote hardware interrupts in assembly language for a short time.  Thinking simple is hard.  Once you get there, it is simple and efficient.  "
Niraj Shah,This is by far my most favorite podcast 'ever'. I really loved Peter Wang too and also Chris Lattner.
xXxno6xXx,Love how humble and down to mars both of them are
AllSaints Academy,Such great interviews with Musk. I have such huge admiration for this man....he's beyond measure.
,This was Elons best interview well done Lexicon
saftmeister r√ºffel,"1:49:23 This is why this man gonna succeed, despite all the FUD around him, look at how the richest man in the world is so polite to some random employee, that's what's makes him authentic, he's just him not bound to any CEO like attitude like a di**"
Eric Graham,"Man, dope interview!  I know people love to hate Elon, but I'm a fan and it was really cool to see him interview / have a conversation with someone that he felt so comfortable with.  You could tell that Lex and Elon had a really great rapport.  I figure they are pretty like minded."
Adrian Bass5,"you do by far the best interviews I have ever seen. I use to watch joe Rogan but, you are blunt and straightforward. well done!!"
¬°nterdimens¬°onal ranger,"""We cant just not have the spaceships come back... spaceships are expensive, we need those back."" E. Musk~

Ryan Kartzke,"Absolutely fascinating, thanks Elon and Lex!"

RSL group,"Finally ! I watched the whole book I'd say because it's extreamly useful

Zach S,"i love your interviews lex, the first podcast  i saw you with was elon musk, and wow it blew me away to see someone my age discussing the things i worry about with a heavy hitter like elon musk. you are so inteligent and articulate as well as unbiased, YOU HAVE ME HOOKED KIND SIR, !!!  now im going back to your first podcast and i intend to watch them all. im a schizophrenic, and these world issues keep me up at night, it sucks, but when i hear things from these experts moderated by you it gives me hope in our future as a human race, thank you and keep up the good work... thanks (SERIOUSLY)  Zach, midwest, usa."

no time 4 evolving monkeys,"What a genius! Thanks to Elon and people like Eric Dubay with his movie ""LEVEL"" was pretty inspiring aswell.  Exciting times ahead forsure"
dunkinvideos,"Love how relaxed and goofy Elon is with Lex, he must feel comfortable with our Lexbot 3000"
CHRIS BROESKY,Definitely one of his best interviews. You can tell he enjoyed it. He's missing his Whiteclaw though.
Hristo Mitkov,"My vote for ""The podcast of the 2021"". Such a nice surprise for the holidays.  Great timing, great topics and questions.   Thank you, Lex! You are getting better and better, man! Oss!"
Caster Headquarters,"Great conversation between you both! How has this video not received more views already? Everyone should watch any interview with Elon. So much great information, advice, and overall a deeper understanding in a magnitude of topics that everyone should keep up with."
Varun Nikam,It was a great interview and loved it 
Merlien Houwen,"That was Inspiring! Ô∏è
Mr Musk has such a great way of explaining things, even a mere mortal such as myself understood most of it! "

Zahub Shahid,This is the most laid back and relaxed version of Elon I've seen on any podcast.
James Gonzales,"The conversation that the two of you have is nothing short of epic in the way that you both compliment each other.  Without a doubt, I would vote you both in as president and vice president, because between the two of you you know what should be changed to make things better and how.  Peace and health to you both and great show, Jim"
Pascal,"Hey Elon, I‚Äòm german and i thank you a lot for giving me the chance to work in the new tesla gigafactory here in germany. I will do my best to study on the side and help change something big Ô∏è Someday i‚Äòll shake hands with you and we do even more for this world and to safe her "
Doug Green,I‚Äôve watched this 10 times..great questions equaled great answers. Big fan of you both
A C,"This was one of the best podcasts Ive heard in forever. To see Elon enjoying himself, thinking deeply, answering hard questions, and seeing his humanity was amazing."
Lentax,"Thank you for what you do, Elon! The sacrifices we will never know about, the pains you took, the possibilities, and for the hope. I'm excited about us. I'm excited about us, humans, so more because of you! Us! Humans! Thank you, sir. Thank you."
Wael Bouabda,Elon musk is appearing on the pod almost as often as Michael Malice does! Getting my popcorn ready this one is a banger!
Jteach91,First time I've ever seen let Friedman starstruck. Awesome to see how much he appreciates the presence of sir Elon Musk. 
sonia hua,I love this the best interview I have ever watched.
acedudeism,"Elon is here to help us along to remembering  who we are . If it came down to it he‚Äôd easily make weapons to help protect earth.

When I was sentenced to life in earth , this planet is where I‚Äôll be forever"
Jtroulston,I love the fact that elon always pauses and gathers his thoughts before he answers
XFORMA,"Awesome Vibes, Lex. Great job. It's you who should try Standup!"
Andrew Fender,"Lex: [esoteric question about literal rocket science]
Elon: [in-depth answer, exploring multiple tangents]
Lex: what is love?
Elon: now you're asking really perplexing questions"
Sean E Cash,"Wow I‚Äôve never seen two AI robots have a long, one of one conversations like this before. Crazy!"
Tdl Australia,He seems to open up to you a lot more. Probably because you give him time to think a question through before answering and you don't ask typical stupid questions. Great job man.
jeff h,Musk is a huge hero of mine now. He has done what no has done. Its amazing. When this man speaks people need to listen.
Joey Kostyk,"Ya better do some stand-up, Elon! Keep up the quality work."
RonBurg88,Hundreds of years in the future robots will hold these conversations in high regard to their existence.
Simon Zimmermann,"When Elon talks about possible outcomes and he laughs, you know there's gonna be explosions :)"
Duke Cunning,I just started watching this video. Elon is telling Lex about the design of his rocket engine. I keep thinking how he would have performed doing what Bob Lazar was hired to do at S-4: analyzing and reverse engineering a gravity engine running on element 115. I would love to know if Elon Musk has watched the Joe Rogan episode with Bob Lazar.
Emergence,Lex is the right person to be interviewing Elon.
josh price,"""spaceshipping is really, really hard and its complicated and there are parts"" wow! E-man is so brilliant! Best interview EVER!!! I can die now."
Tyler Stamps,Thank you Lex(icon) for sharing extraordinarily epic content
monoceroxbeast,"Best Muskerview I've seen yet, by you or anyone. Kudos Lex."
darcide caesaria,Lex is cool as ice man... Much love to Mr. Musk...a true inspiration.
Lou Skunt,Elon is our greatest asset. Period.
aqynbc,"I remember when they had their first interview. Elon was quite cold, but professional. 3rd time around, both enjoying each other's company. Great to see."
MILO,Elon wakes up every day and literally works toward making us an interplanetary species.. #BigGoals
Rory Chivers,"2:29:01 I'm glad Elon is a guide reader, that means there's at least a fighting chance we as a species wont repeat the Golgafrincham mistake of sending all our telephone sanitisers into space"
BigBoy Baggins,"Podcasts like this are a modern treasure. Listening to Inspiring people or just goofy people, funny people, successful people of all sorts and looking deeper into their mind beyond a scripted tv/online segment is so valuable."
Khalifa Binhendi,"When you ask questions that actually make Elon pause to think, you know you asked the right question."
Joel Allen,Lmao I love it. Explaining memes to Elon Musk for 15 minutes.
Jim Payne,"Elon is such an extraordinarily busy person, so it means a lot for him to give 2.5 hours of his time to someone. It shows the level of respect that he has toward Lex -- respect that has been well earned."
Brad Bryant,"I love watching him break our constricting Rules of Communication by actually STOPPING and THINKING before answering a deep and thoughtful question. He refuses to follow the ""sound ‚Ä¶ confidently spoken within 6.5 seconds - necessary to demonstrate the robotic nature of ""call & response"" - only to be expected from our Question and Answer/ Memorization-based Educational System."
Fabian Mango,"Holy shit, imagine getting 2 and half hours of one of the busiest man on the planet for your podcast, man. Respect, you totally deserve it!"
Warren S.,"Wow, Elon Musk on you podcast! You've surely come a long way Lex. Congrats & great job serving up deeply interesting and thought-provoking lines of questioning to such a brilliant mind. This is true gem of a podcast!"
Major Payne,Amazing interview. Thank you.
Dario D,"Lex:  ""this  and that is incredibly difficult to be achieved""
Elon (calmly):  ""yeah  , we are doing it ""   :D"
Mike Gerke,"One of the keys to self driving is to operate the vehicle in such a way as to avoid the unexpected, reactionary situation, which leads to crashes and human mortality.  And that is what is being solved, here in our lifetime."
vids eo,Loved the questions you asked awesome interview thanks LexÔ∏è
Tyler D,The difference in how he handles these interviews is a completely different level than his first one on JRE. Glad to see the growth.
Deep Blue,I have so much respect for this man about the prayer comment.. Almost all of us are guilty of calling upon a God we didn't believe exists but hope that does in times of extreme stress. Bravo sir..
pxyfox2000,"It‚Äôs a very interesting, however, small of an opportunity to observe Elon taking his time, regardless of how silence is sort of frowned upon in these types of interviews, to seriously contemplate some of the questions that Lex asks him. 
These are obviously specific things he has never considered before otherwise I assume he wouldn‚Äôt need to contemplate it. So bravo to Lex for coming up with such unique questions so as to make Elon actually pause. "
Maggie Tattersfield,Shame there aren‚Äôt more men like Elon Musk around. I love himÔ∏è Huge respect for his awesome mind and kindness‚Ä¶ 
Rasputin,The more I listen to him the more I think he's a genuine guy.
Frisbee,Thanks Mr. Musk for adding horror to my life. Blessings Ô∏è
Eric C,I loved how Lex let the interview breathe. The moments of silence (where I had to check to see if the video was buffering or stopped) actually added gravitas to the question and subsequent thoughtful response. It was like Elon was playing out all of the probabilities of his responses before answering. Amazing to watch (and listen!) Way better than the WSJ interview‚Ä¶ Keep up the great work!
Taysky,This is the best conversation between two aliens I‚Äôve ever hear in my life. 
Shirley Mason,"Another question: some physicists have said that in time, with advances in engineering and science, the Earth can be moved farther out from the Sun in order that the Earth can survive comfortably when the Sun expands, but I never hear Elon mention this possibility."
CHARLES,"Excellent interview Lex.
This Elon is an admirable brain 
The problem I have is the more I listen to him the more I feel like an idiot  lol"
Javi Tormo Casta√±o,So interesting. Thank you for this. Congratulations 
Bob Johnson,"The ""future of work as optional"" deal has been something I've been seeing as clear for the last 5 years or so. You'd end up with a highly digital society, I call it a leisure society, where the arts and employing creative ventures is most of the currency as well as social creativity. This is coming from a generally conservative dude, fiscal conservative. The currency base will have to be some sort of UBI on a digital basis. Goods and services would be running around the clock creating this sort of super excess, extending to everyone, same with energy production, and certain skills and abilities and trades optional. You may even run into a situation eventually with robotic rights when these machines begin to make the second or third generation due to their complexity. We will make the first generation and they will make the second generation."
Chance Mack,Lex has been going insane with the guest he‚Äôs brought on recently.
Lezley Thurman,"Lex Fridman I very much appreciate that you allow time for an in-depth response from Elon, he is amazingly open and patient.  I was a bit dismayed at the lame cartoons as it came across as though you were mocking him."
M Mariner,"I love Elon's quotes ""Put in a hard day's work and try to be useful to humankind ... create more than you consume ..."" and ""learn a little about a lot of things ... read about a broad range of topics"" as advice for our next generation!!!"
Da NaRuD 3,This man‚Äôs true genius is realizing overtime how his intellect could help the world and taking action
Zoltan Palcut,"Great conversation Lex, as always. Do you plan to interview Demis Hassabis at some point?"
Haiden Geary,"Firstly, I adore Elon. Amazing man. What I find very annoying, is when he, or others, talk about ""If you want something, go for it."" Yes, Elon has worked extremely hard, but he did not start out on his own. Very few people start out poor, and get to his level, if any. It helps to come from a well-off family. The ideas I have, it's tormenting, but I struggle with simply surviving, never mind the capital to do such things."
Degen,17:07 I like it when you ask him even a relatively simple question he really thinks about it deeply and doesn't have a predetermined answer in advance.
Jade Freeman,"best interview ever :) i can see why folks choose to be on your show, you ask great questions"
Aaron L,"Elon speaking to an AI he created for 2.5 hours, this is coming full circle"
Siris Mc,"One question I‚Äôd like to ask is Mars has two moons.  One is in a death spiral and destined to  hit Mars in the future. 
If we try to colonize Mars. How will we stop the moon from destroying everything we do there.  Colony wise, terraforming etc."
The Spangled Yank,"""So you're saying there's a chance"". Best quote of the entire interview."
Shirley Mason,"As an old COBOL (and CICS) programmer, I think it would be fun to work on those old systems. But then I always loved that work. Debugging is a FUN challenge."
Major Payne,16:16 - 17:50 this is the key to achieve anything you set out to do. Words to live by. Powerful wisdom.
Andrew baker,"As Lex Fridman said at the start of this video, Thank you Elon Musk "
Peter,"Dude I swear, whenever I see Lex do an interview with Elon they both get so close to passing the turing test."
Clint Westwood,I learn so much on how to be a more productive person by listening to these two
Mark Barber,"@Elon Musk and @Lex Friedman.. Run for office!! Need more brave,intelligent man like yourselves running the show! US Senate.... Two humans i dig.. Coo folks! üá∫üá∏"
Blindsquirrelsnut99,"I love these two!!
Is it me, or does Elon seem more like an Artificial intellectual robotoid???
I'm probably overthinking,"
JohnFord706,"Omg... Elon, you give good interviews."
Concerned American,When I lived at the first Home of NASA I could just feel how illusionary it was
xVoR_Tex,I like how Elon Musk is way more comfortable in this one than the previous ones
Felipe Grille,How amazing it would be to look through a telescope pointing back at Earth from a lunar base.
Z3N Bluster,I like that Elon has no qualms about being silent and deeply thinking through Lex's questions. This also shows Lex's skill in finding questions that even Elon has not previously considered. Keep up the good work Lex! You should drink with Elon next time!
MUNX PROJECTS 2022,.. it took me two days to listen this but it was all worth it: Thank you for awesome content. #greatstuff #maketheworldbetterplace #doitnow
Jock Doubleday,"Hopefully, Elon, who is a good man, will soon be read in on the Secret Space Program."
Neo Klymm, The burn at the end!  He asks Elon a question about Love and Elon says ask better questions! 
3kko Used Flash,Elon the greatest man of our time. My idol and hero ...
TheMichael310,How do you land a 2 hour interview with the world's richest and innovative man? Nice job!
Brandon May,I recognize and appreciate how comfortable Elon is on here. Doing Gods work Lex
Marcus Sassan Motamedi,"I like what I see, this type of conscious aware conversation. Its hard to keep up at points with Elon. Has Lex done a interview with Donald Hoffman? I couldn't find any."
Will Sani,I love how he doesn't even think about the idea for a 'source of strength'.  The smashingly successful people often  are their own source. They are so inwardly driven they never think to look for an extrinsic source.
Mango Fett,The direct democracy thing is really interesting. My friend once said to me that one day everyone will be able to vote on policy as individuals on their phones. I think it would be a much better system than representative democracy personally.
coznic,Best advice from this was about reading a broad range to find your passion in life (to be useful or otherwise) or purpose or whatever. Kinda like learning more about yourself by reading an Encyclopedia Volume and/or a broad spectrum of topics.
Geoff Carr,"Lex interviewed Elon in April 2019.  Elon said the presence of a driver next year (2020) will decrease safety in Tesla with autopilot.  Maybe next year, or the year after, or the year after, or the year after, or the year after."
Ruan M. Marinho,"This is information directly from psychedelics. Especially the end where they talk about meaning. I wish people would ask Elon about that topic and his thoughts. He wouldn‚Äôt have to admit to the use of it, but I would love to see his thoughts on it."
Stuey Collins,"1:39:00 

Lex: ""Do you see a world when there are hundreds of millions of Tesla Bots performing different tasks throughout the world?

Elon: ""I haven't really thought about it that far into the future..."""
Kiyoshi Suzaki,"Always intriguing to hear Musk‚Äôs thinking process with the first principle of physics - or the fundamental laws of nature.  It is as if to streamline the flow from a confused state so that blockages are removed - as in great art - or even spiritually speaking.  Since I see us made from such an attempt (or the laws of the universe) for us to be alive here and now - even breathing and more.  So, here is his quote; ‚ÄúWhen something‚Äôs important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.‚Äù  Similarly I believe Henry Ford said, ‚Äúif it is desirable and right, it is not impossible.‚Äù"
Sean Tivald,"I'm still curious how these autonomous cars will operate in adverse weather; especially with semi's. I didn't hear that asked, has all testing has been done in ideal conditions? Ideal conditions are only in a few places on earth."
Bmalugin,This man does what he does cuz he's got the weight of future generations on his shoulder. He loves to be able to create a world for tomorrow
Manish Pingale,"I have seen  many interviews of Elon but the questions asked just wasn't really great.Even the one with Joe Rogan wasn't the best , I felt like that podcast was just 2 friends talking nothing else,But this one , this one was different man! This one is the best interview of Elon that's out there. 
I loved it "
Ali Mamman,"Nothing is more sincere than a person taking time to ponder a question. It increases the probability that the answer will be useful‚Ä¶and mostly unique. Thanks Lex, thanks again Elon."
Clsrk Simpton,We really should be solely focusing on space travel for our entire lives
Brian McLeod,"You can just tell how comfortable Elon is talking with Lex. Absolutely amazing podcast,very informative and thought provoking."
Marian Marcali,"Folding or warping might be achievable. So to bring two separate points in space together, meaning conceptually  they should be indistinguishable or fully entangled and quantum isolated as best as possible. And reintroduce the information at the receiver very carefully. But also, there may be no need to worry about causality, at all, space time will adjust accordingly."
Don Swope,"I just spent 2 hours and 45 minutes watching two men speak in what can only can be described as a foreign language. I understood zero of what they said, but stayed for the entire show."
The Empty Atom,"So somehow they got to the moon in 69 but lost the technology to do it again, and we are still trying to overcome the major tech problems to try to get someone to the moon until this day - amazing."
Ruell Black,"It was very interesting that Elon said ,‚Äùyou just have to make sure you‚Äôre physics ‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre violating conservation of energy and momentum‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs not going to work ‚Äú. Very interesting how he said that."
Luis Hernandez,"This was my first full Lex Fridman podcast, I hope one day it will become as popular as Joe's podcast which is where I met a lot of other interesting people to follow and listen to"
CantWait,"Lex's interviews with Elon are my absolute favourite. He can be both serious and funny, but you can tell he's comfortable around Lex. He's cool with taking a moment to think before answering."
Houlipaints,Sometimes Elon takes several seconds to respond to a question and I freak out because I'm convinced it's my wifi shitting the bed again
Arnaud 335I,This was amazing. Thank you.
Muse California,"I appreciated this conversation because it seems Lex sees beyond the surface sheen.  Elon Musk is a real person, a human being who has aspirations and light and dark aspects to him personally and professionally.  I wish more interviewers would stop fanning out over his money and genius for a second, and begin to speak to Elon on a more balanced, clear level so we can start a real conversation."
John Collins,"Awe inspiring is the work on software.
Would like to here more of the robustness when in situ. That is the acceptance test."
exileinrosedale,"He never stops being my favorite human on the planet. If he needed a Music Producer/Recording Engineer for Tesla or SpaceX, I'd be there in a heartbeat."
xflyingtiger,"Loved this interview. I was struck by Elon's advice for life, ""Try and be useful."" He went on to say that being useful was incredibly difficult. I believe being useful can be simply a state of mind. My daughter manages an AM/PM selling junk food and gasoline. But she is so important for so many people just going through their day. To some many people, filling their tank on the way to work and grabbing a quick cup of coffee and some donuts is such a vital part of their day. My daughter keeps a very clean well stocked store and she is polite and cheerful to everyone she meets. She actually attracts repeat customers. How do I know? Customers have told her so. She is, in short, useful. We all have purpose if we look for it"
cFluff,The whole terraforming Mars is a very optimistic idea to say the least and I‚Äôve read legitimate concerns it‚Äôs not even possible if the planets core is inactive.
Bloom In resONAnce,"Favorite interviewer 
Elon shouldn‚Äôt waste too much time giving interviews to people who stay too shallow

On the other hand"
mercster,"I think it takes someone with a certain level of moderate intelligence to see this guy's accomplishments and be in awe.  I know some people who don't like Elon Musk, and I can only rationalize this in my brain as someone who doesn't understand.  It's like someone who doesn't like their McDonalds hamburger and blames Ronald McDonald.  People aren't educated enough to understand the giant leaps in technology and science that this guy has spearheaded.  And by educated, I mean having gained knowledge and life experience, not necessarily inside a ""school system""... I have a high school equivalency diploma, but I know enough to recognize greatness when I see it.  People think things like massive rocket-ships fall out of the sky and you just need some figurehead to administer everything.  Yeesh."
Dennis jutzi,"This material is way over my head. You are giving me great information. The reason I still watch these is that I still believe in on osmosis can .
You to are to be commended. "
LibertasË≤°ÂãôËá™Áî±ÁêÜË≤°ÊïôÂÆ§,great interview with in depth questions
,"I'm still waiting for Elon to conquer the universe so he can focus on less important things, like his own line of colognes called Elon's Musk."
Catherine Epright,"I was very interested in the answers about money on Mars as I was wondering about that after watching a video about his Mars plans‚Ä¶ like~ will there be currency on Mars? Or is it all about resource allocation and contribution? Who makes laws? (Or regulations) Who decides on what punishments are? Or is this Mars colony run like a business or corporation? Than I began to wonder where the most energy is provided to cells in an organic structure, and perhaps that is the correct way to allocate value to ‚Äújobs‚Äù on Mars since it‚Äôs a ‚Äúclosed system‚Äù It‚Äôs all just so fascinating!!!! Thank you Lex!!!"
Michael,"""Quitting is not in my nature, fuck that we're getting it done"" wow, words to live by"
Death Valley Dazed,I loved the long silent pauses between the questions and Elon‚Äôs reply. That brain of his is X   10 that of mine. Who else can lead us to Mars? He‚Äôs perfect for the job!
Tommy T,"38:04 what I often think about in relation to this is fighter pilots in the second world war.
They would over speed the aircraft and lose control.
The speed of sound was seen as a limit but we developed ways of getting round these problems.
Just speaking hypothetical crap, what if we discover a way to bypass the Higgs field, Maybe we wouldn't need a fraction of the energy that we think is needed to travel at the speed of light?."
Rina Dror,The future is already here. On the way to outer space: when the American dream meets the audacity of Alon Musk who makes his mark on humanity.
Nicolae Ivanescu,"Could one be able to drive manually using the vector space and fully opaque windows on the car? if so then the vector space is fine even now and the control needs to deal with uncertainty better, no?"
Joschua,Lex is so kean with the questions he makes elon musk go in laidback slowmo. great work Lex
White Bunny,With most other interviewers I feel that I've heard it all and I'm just listening to Elon say things he's said a 1000 times. Not with Lex. His questions really allowed Elon to go deeper and share his thoughts in ways that we would never hear from 99% of other interviews. Thank-you Lex. What a beautiful way to spend the first few hours after midnight on new years day (for me).
Wills Boone,Sometimes I just want to stop and give Elon or even lex a big hug
Go 01100110 01110101 01100011 01101011 01101111 01100110 01100110,I think the problem many have when it comes to the bigger picture about electric vehicles is... We need to separate the electric motor from the battery in peoples minds.  Once electric motors are powerful enough that they can replace traditional raw power... You can then address distance in a hybrid way.  Electric motor will always be more efficient.  This will allow for a more robust manufacturing model where gas and diesel are just generators that address the distance issue and used where battery cannot provide enough.  Streamline how people think and you will sell the electric model.
Plastic,I‚Äôll have a Tesla bot driving my Tesla so we can get on the hov lane
Evern A. Cuvalay,"I like to listen to Elon Musk, very smart person."
Kevin O'Connor,Please let Elon do a stand up act. Even if it was not going good. I would like to see that.
Brod,"So awesome that Elon is chilled out and having fun with Lex, such a different energy to other interviews. You rock, Lex. Can‚Äôt wait to see what you do in 2022."
Numbaone Sp.,"What if there was a signal projecting an accurate vector space on any given road? Premapped vector spaces? Basically, start developing smart roads. At the very least having technology within the road could provide estimations of best course of action on the given terrain. There could also be a high-speed information exchange between proximate cars. Also, with regards to the kid/truck conundrum, what if the road had pressure sensors, which would alert vehicles around that there is human activity on the road?"
RINDA in The Raw ASMRnMORE,"Elon can call on me, if needing a break for much needed play time 
I promise to switch things up as needed  "
David Alvarez,"From two lines to a plane to a takeover of the industry of traveling brings down
The costs of energy consumption complements the space industry"
MaT,"I would love to see Elon Musk interviewed by Russell Brand. That would be it. This guy is interviewed mostly by people who cant/dont want to challenge his ""ideas"". Not that I dont like Lex F, but he is kind of going along with whatever EM says. Interesting interview, but not really enlightening."
MoneyIsSilver,Good to see Elon now understands crypto to the level I did in 2012.
Back 2 Basics,"I'm so happy to see Elon in such a good mood! He seems to be happy in life at the minute, good for him!"
Kristin Woodward,Wow you guys are so stoned  nice ‚Ä¶ love you both and love you more 
19quiz76,"I think I‚Äôve seen the lion‚Äôs share of Elon interviews, and for the last couple of years it‚Äôs been sort of like watching an old movie again and again. 80% of the questions he‚Äôs been asked have been uninformed or at best old news. 
This interview, on the other hand, is monumental in the storytelling of Elon; the questions are qualified, relevant, humble, challenging, respectful and full of love. You, dear Lex, are a giant! Thank you for this gem of a conversation "
Rivianado,Blows my mind that Elon isn‚Äôt familiar with smart contracts in the context of Lex‚Äôs question. There are many hundreds of use cases for his various companies and products.
Kloppstock,I love those long stretches of silence after a question. The grinding gears are palpable.
GDawg2K2,"Having lived through the Apollo missions, it was the complete lack of what followed that was the final nail in the coffin of America the great!"
Numbaone Sp.,"When I think of robots, I think really efficient ones would be ones with several arms like the guy in spirited away who sends up bath tokens."
Tony Easley,I like Elon's Thoughts on Government.  Especially the cleansing of regulations. Elon for president 2028
Don Fields,"Having someone like Lex interview Elon is amazing, 2 people that can actually communicate at a ""similar"" level. Try getting mass media to even listen to a sentence of this and their heads will explode. Excellent interview."
Atilax,"@ 17:07    Elon Musk shows his humanity, honesty and dedication...  During an introspective, searching silence you could never find in other great minds of the present.
Elon, your lack of artificial confidence, gives me hope.
I can only hope that your ""human"" imperfections never leave you."
Zach Hooker,"FSD  autopilot talk
Lex: ' 11 is a cool number' 
Elon: 'yeah its going to be  a single stack'
Lex: 'a single stack!'"
K Khera,Great show   
SpaceAce114,17:06 Thought we had blue screen moment but the robot was just sifting through his file routines to execute the code
marianne faulkner,It would be most interesting to engage Musk and Putin as your guests for joint interview.   Maybe possible kept to science / universe interface.   Great response from Musk.   Respect

Apollo Jetic,One of a Kind. We need more people like Elon Musk on our planet.
Magoo X,Imagine a self driven d1 drift machine 
xKen,"This is such a great example of an INFJ talking to an INTJ/ENTJ. Lex keeps on trying to relate everything to humans, emotions, morals, belief...etc. Elon just wanna get shit done and focus on practical solutions lol ""I don't care about optimism or pessimism. Fuck that, we're gonna get it done."" Damn."
Paulus Iipinge,"When Elon says he has the advanced technologies, he is not lying or bragging  HE IS THE MOST HONEST PERSON IN BUSINESS..."
Jeff Banks,"""We had to invent a bunch of alloys that don't exist"". Classic Elon. I love this guy"
Dale Smith,"Elon, I support you in all that you do. I know you are a brilliant man.  I know there are those who want you to fail. I  yes, pray for your success . It was so awesome to you say that before the launch, you got on your knees and prayed (I know that is the single most important thing you did for its great success). Elon, please make prayer part of your very busy life . Thank God for your great success. "
555 kw,"One of the few interviewers that can keep up with Elon or can at least elicit more thought provoking/technical conversation, thank you Lex"
bahar patel,"Elon Musk is one of the most prolific brilliant minds out there! 
And he is so much fun "
Lady Ellen Sings,"Elon looked so emotional,so human."
glen cecil,"Don't try to have a big impact on the world, just try to be useful. So said a truly great man. Elon Musk."
Mark Henning,Like the commentator and of course alone they speak the absolute best of humanity what a wonderful way for countries to work together instead of certain less productive endeavors!
Bakhtiyor Sulaymonov,Great interview 
Frank Frisby,What‚Äôs nice about lex interviews compared to others with Elon is Lex ask real questions and dive deep. That‚Äôs why I appreciate this podcast.
Hermit Rob,"A once in a lifetime genius. And I, as anyone should, don't use that word lightly. The Tesla, Edison, Einstein, Von Braun, Tsiolkovsky, respectively, and Goddard of our time. Above all, truly I believe, has humanities best interests at heart. Could care less about meeting 9.99% of ""famous"" people, but would absolutely love to hang out with Elon for day, or a week. Side note: Isn't it amazing how long he takes to answer a complex question? The amount of thought, and calculation to give an accurate answer. I counted 22 seconds on the ""put a man on Mars"" question."
Cgreenie,The amount of times i checked to see if the video was buffering but Elon was just thinking is countless 
Linda Brown,"I love you, Elon too. It's time that we have hope for humanity to hear you say such positive statement. I know I have given up.  Thank you Jesus."
Reno Raines the BH,"I'd really would love to know, how we be able to protect ourselves from hackers, as everything will become fully automated eventually. Because I don't see how is that possible, the industry is booming, already you can make huge money by creating cheat tools for games, which makes it appealing to more software engineers each day. And this will only continue to raise. It will allow anyone who is tech savvy to access great power in the future."
ML Le,"Very direct inspiration n humor interview math, physics, C++ specially loves. Thank you."
Andrew Bathurst,"I love the way you navigate conversations Lex, you're base simplicity makes conversations almost seamless. I see your ability to throttle the conversations and allow the listener/guest to consolidate their energy to respond as accurately as possible. It's a beautiful skill to witness!"
MegaSogni,Thank you Lex Fridnan and Elon Musk.
Diasporalogue,The long pauses before he responds. Powerful interview
ScrewB,Greatest vaporware salesman of all time.
A YouTuber,Is it possible to somehow concentrate the water molecules in the air in a long line when the sun is shining to create a magnifying glass like effect ? I wonder this because when a water drop lands on a leaf it burns sometimes and I was thinking about tools the sun can be/has been used for.
Manav Patra,"@1:02:00 - 1:02:40

One of the highlights of this podcast. Yes, Elon's well read!"
Chuong Nguyen,Great podcast to end the year 2021. Listening to this 2h30m conversation feels like as a 5min. But it packs information of a thick book. Thanks a lot Elon Musk and Lex Fridman.
Cusion Wong,"'Fuck that, we're getting it done' - best quote ive ever heard in my life"
Rohith Dsouza,"A short summary:



- Finishing high stress situations sucessfully you feel more relief than elation

- Most difficult problem regarding starship is engine production, right from the materials to design you have to have the best of everything to make the best engine"
Greer Evans,A world that works and nobody gets left out. Make it real.
Paul O'Neil,Time Index 16:15 (this is who Elon is and why he is f'ing amazing as a human) - We just have to keep doing this or die trying - Elon Musk
Parede 2775,One of the most interesting conversations ever
Kim Sidorski,"It's interesting to note here, that according to William Thompkins, there were ALREADY ET bases on our moon during the Apollo space program. I HIGHLY recommend that anyone watching this video, who's not familiar with Bill Thompkins, research him."
Shard Plays Games,Imagine sending your Tesla Bot in your Tesla Car to go to the store for you lol
Vaughn Macdonald,I‚Äôve never seen Elon take so much time to answer the questions posed. He must have been put at ease in this interview. Awesome video. Epic I think‚Ä¶
Stephanie B,Absolutely my 2 favourites 
Will4May,"I wonder how many rocket staff from around the world watch this while writing notes down, Bezos definitely."
Rodney J Deniston,"Elon, I got it now. I know how we can pass through
the gate to get outside the
Firmament Dome and survive. Also, a diamond
Nozzle will by far improve"
AleKai The Great,I find it hilarious the amount of people who still haven't caught on to the fact that Elon is a horrible person.
amelioration,"Lex, you‚Äôre a very smart, humble man. I‚Äôve personally enjoyed several of your podcast episodes. However,  there‚Äôs one thing that you continually push that bothers me to my core. It‚Äôs the idea of robots being our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù They are not human. Program them all you want but they will never be human? You mention loneliness, etc. There‚Äôs millions of people in the world. If you yourself are lonely, it‚Äôs by choice? Thousands of organizations need volunteers. There‚Äôs clubs everywhere offering a variety of interests. Please stop pushing it & venture out "
Gino Contestabile,"Let's just take a moment to appreciate the wonderful life of opportunities we live today.
I am sitting near the chimney in a 500 people village in center-south Italy. If the Internet didn't exist the only thing I could have done was probably to be a farmer and sell harvests on local markets, speaking italian dialect with no clue about how the world works."
The Idea,Thanks for loving humanity  That's  all it was needed to say . The how it's  done  doesn't  matter.  I hope you reach the goal and desires planned in your lifetime
Jay Fernandez,Elon Musk sense of humor is great!
ElectroPulsed,Good Interview. Would watch it again.
Shore Basher,"I'd want to ask Elon what he thinks about  security for Mars if we set up a civilization, who would protect the colony, who would be allowed in the colony?"
Sales Department,"Thanks to Elon Musk, the example of a deserted island loses its meaning.  a solar battery and a skylink dish can solve all problems."
Ciro Vivacqua,"This is the only interview-based podcast that I've found actually useful. I don't really understand how people survive in this space just by being empathic. Lex has depth on what he brings to the table and clearly it's not because he comes from a software development background, but because he tries to be something else and better. Keep going with the good work."
D P,"Next time you have Elon Musk on could you ask him if he is aware that with his wealth he could singlehandedly stop world poverty and hunger in less than 5 years, and if he would delay his space program for 5 years to fix this problem first?
The sun will last for a couple of million years more, so what is 5 years?"
ShaneyPo0,"A stellar interview. Bravo.  Applause .
Elon has levelled up. He's reached humanities New Evolution status."
Joey,@elon The issue with nuclear powers not necessarily the fur radiation in my opinion. The real issue with nuclear power is the hazardous waste and how do we manage it and store it permanently overtime.  Currently there are no adequate nor permanent facilities around the world (at all) for storing nuclear hazardous waste properly.
Ambi Nwokeabia,"Getting on our knee and pray, when circumstances seem beyond our control is something to think about."
JohnAndBuddy,"I don‚Äôt care about pessimism or optimism, Fuck that, we are gonna get it done.



-Elon Musk"
Wade Crum,Direct Democracy on Mars.  Transperency to all.  Friendly competition.  This guy is awesome.
Lou Belle,Also love the direct democracy approach.
ShaRk.,"Elon's mood is through the roof lately, seems that everything works pretty well in the background, good to see!"
Heinrich Botha,"My favourite thing about Elon is that despite how serious his life is and how much stress he's under, he can still have fun and be silly sometimes."
seelam revanth,great questions lex especially about the Tesla bot!
Sebastian Szajuk,The AI is getting better and better. Im impressed
Peter Thomas,"Seems to me that each planet could have their own currency systems and a buffering mechanism just like watching  video....to allow for the distance in a way that is as good for both sides as possible. 
Cold wallet transfers might be of use...and who knows?
Maybe a quantum entanglement would allow simultaneous financing transfers in defiance of general relativity."
JT Taylor,I love Elon... He's a gangster nerd!
,Amazing work Lex!
Liz Taylor,I'm all in to volunteer to go to Mars. I'm in. Heck? I live in the middle of the Sonoran desert. Summers are so hot that we must stay inside for long periods. I'm absolutely acclimated to being alone if that is necessary for long periods. Let's do this.
Brad Bryant,"Lex.  This was your ""minute with Elon"" and you played it like that ! BRAVO!  You guys speak similar languages. I would guess that by far the bulk of his interviews remain much less technical. I admire that you stayed with your flow, without even bowing to the ""Hoi Polloi's"" need for simplicity/translation. You lost me, and most likely any other chiefly Right brain people (I'm an artist) but I was able to look at Elon and see how the English language (or any language) reaches it's limits (along with the speech ""speed limits"" (governed by the relatively inelastic physiological components of speech - made evident here by ELON's evident to speak as fast as he thinks!  It results in slurring and run-on sentences. This would be expected as a human being is reaching a new frontier of communication - possibly non-verbal - when only ideogram type ideas can be expressed, pre-packaged in order to speed the sharing of dense information."
Chet Jump,"‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about optimism or pessimism. Fuck that, we‚Äôre gonna get it done..‚Äù Elon Musk"
George Einstein,Please ask Elon to develop a voice lie detector device to make this a good world.
Maggi Petty,I'm surprised Elon isn't more concerned with our solar flare problem. He did just lose several satellites. Is there an alternative to components that aren't vulnerable to electromagnetic interference?
xmaczi123,"Absolutely the best interview with Elon. He is such a down to earth, honest and open person. Also excellent questions by Lex."
Niclas Mortensen,"The invention of sandwich is an easy one, that‚Äôs the literal name of the Englishman who was known for making them at his hunting parties or something like that. How it escalated to the entire world is beyond me"
Mighty Mexx,Elon Musk just tweeted about how great your questions were Lex. Great interview!
Paublus Americanus AMERICANUS,"On a recent near accident I had on the road was, I was pulling out into three lanes of traffic from the left. Being older my mind started watching the nearest car to me from the left. A glance to the right for clearance. Mental image was shifted back to the right. Three other cars were coming from the left. When the nearest car from the left passed my mind told me the way was clear. Object permanence should have told me three more cars were coming from the left but it didn't because I am older, 74 and I pulled out got to  near the center and my wife said, OH HON! My brain instantly told me without looking at what I had done and without even looking at the threat of the 65mph cars I nailed the throttle. Without even seeing it I  knew it had missed us because I gained my lane towards these oncoming cars. I am still a good driver having no accidents but this would have killed us both if I hadn't reacted in 200 milliseconds to my wife and nailed the throttle.  Everything had to work correctly after my mistake to save us from my object impermanence distraction."
Westo,Autonomous  driving would prob b soo much simpler to do if we redesigned the road networks for it. Less variables
DarkMX Hishot,Hold on this was three weeks ago? I thought Elon musk already achieved reusable rocket and has done many lunches and landings with them?
Jeep,The 30 best seconds in podcast history!
Excuse my Langqueege,"My man prayed. The fact Musk believes in something more. Is simply, admirable"
Lindo Mavuso,"I absolutely love it when Elon does the thing where he pauses for 30secs before answering a question - it shows that humans need time to process information, as opposed to providing snap reactions"
Jhardy0786,Elon you a very good man God bless you
David Alvarez,"I think progress in travel industry will move airplane development, which will bring the gap between space and sky closer. Imagine a plane leaving orbit."
Claude Snell,Anyone else find it absurd that Elon was not once asked about the UFO/UAP phenomena? I think the fact that this subject was not brought up once in this conversation leaves a lot to be said.
Freddy W,"1:28 ""One stack to rule them all.."" .. That was a play on Lord Of The Rings! 
Love this guy! lol"
Wilfredo Soto,Of all the interviews that I have heard. This is the most monotone I have ever heard Elon. I wish there was more enthusiasm from him on some of the things he is talking about. I think he finally lets off some interest when talking about cones in the eyes. Sheesh.
World of Engineering,"Ok Lex, we have something to watch today, thanks!"
Kyle Duffy,How come Elon has become so much less robotic as the years go by? In early JRE podcasts he was so robotic and almost didn‚Äôt understand jokes or humour to being very outgoing and sociable in recent years‚Ä¶ strange
Joey Kostyk,"Great show, Lex."
professor hawk,"Just finished watching this full video. If you really want to better understand Elon's work, I highly recommend checking out Common Sense Skeptic. I hate to be an advertisement, but I think his videos could change lives here. It all makes sense when someone can break down the math in a simple way."
John G,The logistics question was so funny :-)
Evern A. Cuvalay,How much time is needed to get to Mars vice versa? I have many questions for Elon Musk regarding life on Mas.
Prof. Harvey Crichton,An intelligent interviewer and a few good laughs .They covered a lot of ground. I think Elon actually enjoyed the interview  for once with someone who asked some entertaining and sensible questions.
Robbie Birt,Elon Musk is one of those billionaires who truly is a good person.
Roopesh Chinnakampalli,He always give credit to his team! That's a great leadership quality!
JR Hunter,Elon knows exactly why we have never been back to the Moon. If anyone does it certainly that man robot reptile super villain thing.
Nick Miller,"If lex Friedman built an AI that then built a superior lex Friedman, the product would be Elon musk"
sipho ndebele,"Elon in silence, contemplating how to answer the Question...or... Robot downloading updates..lol"
No Name,"Whats funny with Elon is that he is raw material, and the manufacturer ( itwer), with his questions, manage to get something awesome, interesting or average, but it really is on the itwer shoulders."
PONDERIN' RC,"If we would have allowed space ""economy "" to grow since the 50 and 60s, by now we would have a Luna vacation spot, and everything that come with it and before....maybe not affordable to everyone, but still, 70 yrs and very little innovation"
Desmond Jombe,"""I don't care about optimism or pessimism,  fuck that we're gonna get it done."" Elon Musk, 17:36

Great interview! As usual, nice work Lex"
Ramesh tirumala,"One of the reasons, in my opinion, we have a half-century gap to go next level is the planet has so many issues/priorities poverty, health/pandemics, war, economic growth needed for technology investments, global climate issues that our priorities shifter. With rapid advances in 21st century with digital we are seeing bigger leaps in achievement."
Ana,"1:28 - 1:55 After that first note of thanks and Elon's noble, heartfelt, moving reply, the next question and interviewer's coldness was a disaster. I hate it when an interviewee makes a deeply moving statement and the interviewer totally ignores it, gives zero recognition, and just shoots out the next totally unrelated, relatively trivial question, just to get through their prefab agenda."
Kourtney Towner,We love you Elon.
david theproducer,I admire how Elon thinks before he speaks.
Alexandre Boavida,"Listening this today, with the ongoing war, feels... at least surreal"
Masha Vasilenko,"My husband and I are listening to this (long-awaited!) interview while driving across California for our vacation. Our 3.5 y.o old has fallen asleep, and we can enjoy the episode together! Such a great holiday treat!
Oh, and Elon‚Äôs pauses make us think whether sth is bad with our Internet connection, or he‚Äôs taking time to think. Apparently, the latter "
Galaxia,"What I thought was surprising is that he said the robot is made for dangerous and monotone tasks and he hadn't thought about of it as being a companion. But then says it would be able to get a unique personality and be a great buddy. But it doesn't need a personality for these kinds of jobs. So he either changed his mind on making it a buddy then and there, it's a side effect because they're basically trying to make a human and then this can happen, or he doesn't actually know what's going on and how it will exactly turn out."
Numbaone Sp.,"On a monetary standpoint, I believe a real-time wage could be very useful for poorer people around the world in different societies. To be able to work and get paid by the second into a personal account, or even faster, would help so many people who don't have the financial conscientiousness to keep themselves and their families afloat. I also think this could help towards homeless populations. For example, a homeless person might be able to clock in with a litter picking device and earn money in real-time for however long they choose to litter pick. Moreover, this concept could be a great tool to prevent starvation as people would be able to, with minimal effort, earn enough to at least eat."
Forbesartworks,Elon look like very  straigth forward human give time to this man he experiment things that usually we don't see normally more than technology
driftplayz,9:01 These rocket engines are powerful and from Russia is because Russia forced Germany to make them really powerful engines back in the 1980s and I think there called raptor engines like that RD-180 and RD-170.
Peter,The most frustrating thing about Lex‚Äôs interviews is that he asks a question and then answers it himself. What is the point of the guest if you don‚Äôt let them speak?!
Syncopia,Getting Musk to be in the same place for nearly 3 hours is an incredible feat. Keeping engaged with him for that same amount of time is beyond impressive.
IAMGF,"The past, the present and the future had to wait for Elon Musk to come along and become a billionaire by putting the benefit of humanity first. 
It really irks me the entire world is run by rules from 1800 & 1900's law. A perfect example is NASA vs SpaceX, Ford vs Tesla, and so on. Forget the ""drawing board"" and the chalk! Just get on with it, use the advanced technology and listen to your subordinates!"
Kyle V,Every time Elon says ‚Äúorder of magnitude‚Äù we take a drink 
Will Sani,"""It's like karate kid. With the fly. But much bigger."" giggles.  How can you not love this guy!?!"
RealKevinLive,A loss of humanity is inherent in the contract to be super human artificially. That is the influence driving it all
Valerie DiMattia,And to feel the sun on its skin absorbing the rays of light is a phenomenon I describe as delicious
Einar,"47 mins in: How about this: Laws passed by minimal majority have expiration. You need a 2/3 fully representative (i.e. it can't be half the people got sick and 2/3 of the remaining people voted) to make a law ""permanent"" (still eligible for review)."
Interstellar Traveler,"The most profound words from Elon - ""Fvck that we're gonna get it done"""
Adam Bednarczyk,"It's interesting to see the differences in dialogue between Elon with Rogan & Elon with Lex. Both are great interviewers in their own right, but you can see that Lex is in a better position to understand the complexities of what Elon is breaking down from a technical standpoint. It's clear Elon really enjoys this interview- Lex speaks his language."
Ruell Black,"Interesting‚Ä¶. Lex said, ‚Äúgeneral relativity ALLOWS for wormholes will humans be able to leverage this‚Ä¶.. ‚Äú . The manner in which he purposed this question opens up sooo many other questions."
Winston Doug,Imagine the form of government it would work best on a civilization in space indoor Mars would be whatever voting system or Democratic process that a group of scientists would use when working on an important project. Instead of politicians we would need physicist and engineers scientists all those fancy pants smart people. No electing people because they have a good smile and they give a good speech.
Melisa Azra,I hope he do all he dreams i know he is a genius
Colin Redwood,Thank you for doing what you do Lex. I've learned so much from your interviews.
Shaheen Adams,Sunset clauses on regulations requiring a re-vote is just brilliant.
Steven Gulie,"I have to say, this is one of Elon‚Äôs best interviews. He tends to get very stiff, or to fall back on repeating things he has said before. Lex, you managed to keep him loose without taking the conversation into inane directions. You really surprised me, as‚Äîto be frank‚ÄîI often find you a bit stiff conversationally. But you pulled it off. Bravo! "
Faab267 Relaxar,Funny those long moments of silence before Elon's answers. I thought I had a sound problem.
maggie calos,Very smart man in this era of science&technology. I'm a senior and do not recall anyone through my life time that has accomplished and shows the drive to achieve great things in the advancement of humanities exploration of the universe.  Great inspiration to the next generation coming through in the science and engineering fields.   :) :)
Yasting L,"Great job by Lex, good mind from Elon. Btw, may I translate this talk to Chinese. and post it on Wechat?"
Marcos Gonzalez,"Elon: ""The future of mars should be left up to the martians""
2200 terrans coming back to watch this after mars delares its independence: "
Shirley Franklin,Love Elon Musk  sign me up for Mars living.
mallon201,"I just love the Musk pauses, less nonsense would be spoken if more of us practised this trait."
David Alvarez,"It‚Äôs easier to look at the pattern than to look at the edge, still both real coworking like chaos and order"
andrew nelson,I had no idea Lex Fridman was an instructor at MIT teaching machine learning for self driving. He was incredibly disciplined in asking interesting questions but avoiding PhD level discussion
05_Pranta Saha,Elon is not just thinking about business he also thinking about humanity.he really want to do something great for us.i really love and respect this man
Slick Rik,"Smart contracts is not just the understanding of the deal, it's the execution of deal"
Daniel Wood,"I was running sound at some country club gig when I saw those men blasting off into space. I stopped and said a prayer for them an my country, not knowing who I was even talking to."
Ed Sherwood,Man Elon‚Äôs such an inspiring person
revolution inevitable,Elon is awesome
Jose Virella Velazquez,Lex is such a great interviewer it‚Äôs ridiculous. Watching this wayyy to late when there is work tomorrow 
Alex Aiz,been waiting to good interview since joe Rogan did one with him .good chat
Nidhi B R,This is what a podcast between 2 AI entities would sound like
Irene S,I love Elon Musk Ô∏è
Michael,I love the garbage collection idea for rules and regulations.
Marsh√© Terry,"""You can sort of look inside your brain, at least like, I can.."" - Elon Musk 1:12:28"
Alex S,I wish Elon had more engineering / science interviews.. love hear him talk about this technical stuff
Boom Crypto,"Hello Lex. I am greatly torn on this Mars issue. I wonder, what if we used all that money to make Earth better? There is evidence of people on mars from the past and evidence of a nuclear war on mars with certain isotopes in the thin atmosphere directly over the portions where green ""nuclear glass"" is found? ( near Cydonia) . If we go to mars without changing our fundamental views on things, will not mars just become another earth with all of its problems PLUS all the issues of feeding and providing enough water for all of the people?"
Valeri Donkov,"Ok, I think is needless to say that Elon actually knows who created Bitcoin, Just pay attention how long it took him to give an answer, and the answer itself"
Derek Chadwick,Elon Musk is such an ENTP 
Arlene Bond,Love you E  your the man !!
Omniscient Sloth,God I love Elon
Robert McAuliffe,"Lex thank you for all the content and conversations that you put out. You remain the best podcast for so many reasons but first and foremost this podcast is an inspiration for many of us dreamers and believers. You're changing the world with every video, thank you"
Alen Samac,The most sincere man in this world.
Raymundo Martinez,Notice how Elon is so much more relaxed and himself with these podcasts rather it‚Äôs Lex or Joe he is not as tense as the first time around. This was a great episode to end the year with!
Patrick M,Elon looks like he's simultaniously in his early 30s and late 60s at the same time
n n,Lex...listening to this interview again-3/2022-Ukraine- Putin... this conversation around evil was  unwittingly  foreshadowing the state of madness and evil this day happening in your homeland. So very tragic. My heart cries everyday. Holding you and all of us in prayer . Kyrie Eleison. Blessings .  
Red Watch,You cant go faster than the speed of light. It takes infinite energy that we don't have.
maximus28ma,"I really like these podcasts, but what I‚Äôm missing is that nobody has European entrepreneurs on. Lex you should have Mate Rimac on."
Dez,"Omgoodness wasn't expecting such a hilarious introduction. But .....what about umm hmm  nevermind . Anyway, I loved it!:)"
Jason DiCioccio,This is the best Elon interview I've seen by a wide margin. He actually looked like he enjoyed the conversation and wanted to be there. The chemistry was great!
Ivan Sostaric,"Key to solve the turbulence in gas is the vessle desigh, my guess would be that in universal numbers lays a pattern that will prove to be close to perfect in refference to making turbulent air flow laminarly at any degree just like some forms of valves make use of laws to do complex work just by design itself. Therefore i guess best way to try to make engine better and more likely to sucssesfully reach its peak preformance, one should dive into researching efect of material its in and pvt state of the gas itself, and design of the flow wessles that transfers the activated proppelent into the exhaust chamber, perhaps there is a way to force turbulant air to balance out by effecting it by the variables in question for flow and also if it is possible to externally force it to do so by magnetism or something even crazyer like quantum directioning by making the proppelent burn in such conditions that the point of going from laminar to turbulent flow is so high that you are within working capacity and able to keep a laminar current of flow. this is my best pitch, this comment is affecting the fate of the humanity."
H R,Over the last 100+ years we burned all fossile fuels we could get our hands on and managed to change the atmosphere by 100ppm. Where exactly is the energy supposed to come from that would allow us to create an atmosphere on Mars?
Sharon Ellul Bonici,"Direct Democracy is the most democratic system I know in a truly functioning democracy. Such a perfect system that makes it  quiet boring. 

Switzerland has adopted this system as there were different cultures and nationalities all libing in harmony "
Jambay,I'm going to have to view this many times just to catch up with what was being done in the past.
Arthur M Perron,I am a big fan of Elon  Musk.
Tony Arreaga,"I‚Äôm so glad Elon finally did more than 30 mins this time! Great job Lex, keep it going!"
Joseph Carpel,"Elon doing comedy, that would be great. I don't doubt he can do some jokes but 15 mins is a lot. Start with 5 brother."
Kristin Woodward,We are so already there we need to open up the evolution of human kind and teach them to love so they can thrive there . I love you chief 
Paul Godwin,"Do rockets have to be launched from inside the atmosphere or from an emissions consideration what keeps us from restricting combustion explosions like those required for launch and landing of rockets to outside our planetary  ecosystem...and wouldnt it require less propulsion. Like an aircraft carrier outside the atmoshphere thats reachable and functional to warehouse and assemble and maintain satellites and relay communications with our bases by cargo type high altitude aircraft. Why cant we build space planes that can enter and leave our atmosphere without the massive impact on our ecology a launch has. Like, how many tesla car  miles are negated in their benefit to our carbon emissions by one SpaceX  launch?"
Bay 6,"I applied first principle analysis to my life and discovered the very first principle. 
 Lex. Prove me wrong. The first thing you must have before anything else, before existence and for the existence of potential itself, is allowance. No.1  A principle. A simple Idea. The simplest there is actually, Just Yes.  "
James G,Woow I want to see them attempt to catch the rocket with the chopstick arms! That is crazy. All for the weight savings!!
North Florida Reptiles,"Lex, one of the best things about your interviews with Elon is your ability to ask him the kinda questions that he normally doesn‚Äôt get asked in interviews. Because of your expertise in AI, engineering, robotics, you can really ask the kinda questions most interviewers aren‚Äôt able to and it gives Elon the chance to expand on these complex things publicly."
Najim Popal,"""The people you want as leaders are the people who don't want to be leaders"" - profound"
zcai2672,"This is why I don't watch any network television anymore... The integrity, depth and breath of this channel(along with a few others) exceeds anything a commercial television can produce."
James Palazzi,"We need to have a serious Moonbase and then a mission to Mars as soon as possible.
which is lots of words so much effort has to continuously push forward for these things to exist.
I think the world cries for success in the Moonbase and Mars.
I  feel our only hope is Elon Musk to push forward."
David Ashby III,"17:15
That thoughtful pause."
E.B.,Elon Musk is greatest of all time
Greg Kelso,"1:48:50 - Elon talks about fuel. Does anyone else feel like the USA is slowly introducing more additives to everyday gas? For example, Buying a full tank of fuel in OR will last you longer than a full tank of fuel in CA. Maybe I am just a dumb truck driver, but it seems like MPG is diminishing in certain States. This may be another weak area in the US economy. Another amazing podcast as expected, thanks Lex, keep up the good work!"
David Soom,Makes me want to buy stock in cool aid.
Doober Dobber,"""As long as people can draw things, there's been a dick pic""

So funny, and so true"
Krishna Dev Yadav,"Basically, Things that were impossible in the morning were possible by the evening."
Atradies Inc.,Elon Musk done everything he possibly could with Nasa to make sure those people were safe. Then a non religious man gets on his knees and prays for it to succeed. That's the man that I would want putting me into space if I got the opportunity to go.
Alan Bok,Great job dudes
John Gordon,The bot could be restricted to certain types of areas of work else we would degrade the abilities of humans and their versatility and inventiveness.
Jess Valenzuela,Will their ever be battery operated rockets to Mars?
Jason Sangwin,"It's incredible that AI has become this good now, these 2 robots are so lifelike."
Annette Jahnel Works,"In the beginning, Elon Musk asserts that we don‚Äôt need new physics, in the middle he reveals a profound and interesting thought process, in the end he stumbles over what is love and consciousness; perhaps because these mental states are not hard and fast, and too clear an answer could be construed as a commitment to fluffy thinking."
Verbal Vertigo,"i think Elon was like this in the beginning to loosen Lex up
a little ""yea we can continue where we let off, im not like the others""
 400 iq."
Erlo Brown,How on earth am I only discovering this channel now?
SIMON HAZARIKA,In the era of dimpu‚Äôs vlog someone in assam will still listen to lex and elon
Ben Marzouk,"Very funny when Lex made a (very stupid) Dumb and Dumber joke @ 15:25, and Elon had no idea what he was talking about and just parroted it back to him. Kind of a metaphor for the entire interview."
Mark Booth,This is why I have a YouTube subscription and cannot remember the last time I watched regular TV except sports. Lex can let an interview evolve in ways regular TV couldn't dream to recreate.
JPC chanel,I am surprised that Lex didn't ask Elon how well the underground loop in Vegas is going...
Hajar Lymani,"I feel super lucky for existing in the time this episode is released and watching these two great brains discussing our future and epic stuff about humanity,  WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!!!"

GA D,It‚Äôs a great man who can say that he‚Äôs not religious but yet he got on his knees and prayed. Thank you Elon.
bengeeone,"Elon mentionning the fuel problems the German had during WW2 reminded me that the Nazis putting their hands on all the fuel they could find in occupy France was one of the reason for french engineer Louis Breguet to create an electric car back in 1941. My grand father had one, I remember seeing it as a kid. I think a few hundred models only were produced. It could go around 50km/hour and travel 100km distance on a charge, and I think it took 24 hours to recharge the battery... no Tesla super charger back then. LOL"

STAN,I didn't know Musk's voice could be so ASMR-inducing lol
Xelzbrod...,"Elon Musk is a wonderful person, he's my hero, he is the only person that is attracted my attention in this world of smoking mirrors, he seems to be a legit down to earth person, if he is doing anything else, he is one hell of an actor he should be in the movies, I believe he is a really a good person that is trying to do humanity the best that you can do. And all I can say is thank you Elon for the electric car ."
T Young,Take your AI and shove it.  I can't wait until the next large CME.
Daniel Richardson,Elon loves an order of magnitude

Kyle Carman,"I‚Äôm for this 100%. But the middle class; I may be biased, but we‚Äôre the ones whom give those in authority the ability to make your aspirations come to fruition.

I‚Äôd rather have my taxes go toward something progressive and block building. Unfortunately, our thoughts and interests are not in the interest and thoughts of those who govern us. "
James Bond,2.5 hours of my time very well spent. Thank you both.

John Broe,"""This is the first time in four and a half billion years to extend life beyond Earth."" What a mindfuck..."
john sherby,He looks like he wants to talk about this every day for 2 hours but never has the time
Rob Camps,"I'm sure Elon has to slow his speech and his thinking to match the normal human, even though this kid is smart you can notice Elon brought to a  layman way of thinking for us"
Let‚Äôs go Random!,The long pauses before answering are when he‚Äôs buffering‚Ä¶..you‚Äôd think he‚Äôd have fixed that already!
Tbilisi_Warrior,"The longer Elon waits the better the answer gets! Love that about him, it's genuine"
Justin Unger,"around thirty minutes elon mentions making a ship that does project its self, but instead moves space around it. I was like wait I've heard that theory before... On futurama like ten years ago"
Jack Parker,In regards to Tesla automatic control accidents..... Who's willing to admit that he accidentally manually overrid the self-control system and was responsible entirely for the accident himself.?.. and should there be some internal systemic record of such an override and logged.. for at least a short while after such override?
Db Parrish,"Info dense, great "
Hank Kingsley,Tesla is certainly not the first to be working on humanoid robots. They won't be the only player in the space.
Fishing Bob,Lex had an opportunity to confront Elon on him not being an real engineer yet he failed to do so.
Nia.D33,the best and most natural friendly relaxed interview i have seen of Elon. Its clear theres a mutual repsect between the two.
Tony Hardy,"Like Elon was saying you can't change physics so you should never try to, you already have the tools, the truth(law/physics). So remember this when you go on to ask questions about what kind of government should be on mars.  Remember the first thing Elon said about law, you can't change the law of physics, so it means you can't change the truth of consciousness either it is the same thing in essence. Remember i said the TRUTH of consciousness, not just consciousness. "
Kayleb Tooley,all i know is his body language when he answers truthfully and wholeheartedly was a LOT different than the awkward yes and self soothing coffee cup sip he took after lex asked if he was the founder of Bitcoin. 
Mind's Eye View,This is my Stand UP I'll be here all week
Greenway,"Lex, reflecting the idea of a Putin interview now, when he truly has NOT  keep 10 toes to peace.  
What next..?   üá∫üá¶"
mightypensword,Just a comment on Elon's direct democracy idea: read about rome in the 130's bc and onward to understand how direct democracy creates demagogues and how demagogues rip democracies apart.
Green Oregonian,"When Elon said ‚Äúwe had to invent several new alloys that don‚Äôt exist to make this work‚Äù around 12:10, so casually like ‚Äúeh‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh."
renegade rabbit,"In the process of accomplishing what‚Äôs never been done before, Elon Musk was able to discover and invent 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 and 20 which are all crucial pieces need to be in place to make Bullseye possible."

adrian allen,elon you do god work love u x
Lucien Antonson,The Jetsons need a Tesla reboot!
Leon Eaves,Does your auto find a parking lot and a parking space at the end of a trip?
Amber in the box,"I watch just about every interview Elon takes the time to do. Many of them kinda drive me crazy. The one with Joe Rogan was good. It was a goofy laid back conversation but it was still really good. I think the one I found the most frustrating tho was his interview with Babylon bee. I started to get ptsd at the end when they started pulling the religious crap with the music and asking him if he'd give his life to christ. Lol imo he's already doing Gods work. I found found it highly uncomfortable. The intro was awkward the questions were....just... dissapointing. I about had a sht fit at the end when the music qued up. Literally made me sick to my stomach. You see him in a lot of other big interviews with him having to constantly repeat the bullet points as if he's saying it all for the first time. I feel bad for him. Not only is he majorly stressed with what he's doing and he does it anyways but he's having to drag literally humanity behind him just to get creeps breathing down his neck. Although I'd gladly breath down his neck hahaha. But you know what I mean. When you see bezos eyes glint with annoyance when people mention him is fun to watch, especially when u hear Elon laugh about it... Dude. Elons my favorite human that we have. And I'm also greatful for lex bringing this to us. Thank you to Lex for having engaging and interesting conversations with Mr. Elon."
A,This guy is doing Tesla and spaceX my son says he can‚Äôt cook and do his laundry at the same time and ask me to do it for him. He better learn from this guy.
Bennyboom,"This is the best interview I've ever seen with Elon. You kept it interesting, asked the right questions & let him explain himself without trying to act like you were an expert on everything he was talking about. Great job!"
Kroken Stiv,"Elon, you ought to intensify your work on reaching Mars! World War 3 is beginning!"
CandyheadXO,Two of my favorite people to intellectually oogle.

I feel the meaning behind that.

John Ryan,Elon is probably the best lager in the world ! He is a realist and a dreamer .
ssb33,Elon got his alien hittaz ready with that heater on standby best believe he don‚Äôt play 
robert castillo,Periodically Elon is perplexed and needs to quickly reboot.
Moni M,"Oh yeah and highest type ""engine"" possible using  100 years technology frankly!  possibly why Elon studders alot.  Hard to lie."
Sunnyboi twin¬•,Lex the goat for ending 2021 with a 3rd elon musk interview  one of the best interviews this year by far
William Wallace,Elon looks like a sushi chef on a smoke break right now
,"Great Interview Lex, Thank you! And thanks Elon!"
Matt Zeccardi,This felt like Lex spent the entire interview trying to prove to Elon that he knows things! If you want a job just ask him Lex!
John Rutledge,Ten million doesn't seem like relativity alot for an upper stage platform . Very exiting !
richteffekt,Bluetooth headphones connection lost or Elon Musk pausing before an answer ?- what a fun game.

Auti O,we need this man to live 100 more years
Beep Beep,"What if we have a transport system in the orbit.  Then have a landing surfacing system that can be cheaper in the beginning.  And launch system in the Mars to the orbiting transport system for only humans.  This way if one component dies, we do not lose everything."

My god, this whole thing was infuriating, the whole market ""discussion"" (literally nothing was said...blows my mind anyone interprets this as being ""profound"" or insightful...oh you don't say, higher cost bad, lower cost good, woooow how brilliant...) at the beginning itself assumes first principles, namely that possibility should be entirely bounded by profitability.  Like...how is this not extremely obvious...I'm sorry but this dude, like all of these sociopathic morons at society's commanding heights akin to the optimates dominion of the late Roman empire, is an absurdly glorified contemporary carnival barker, like your Carnegies, your Jobses, et al. he is the platonic ideal of capitalist; individually squeezing maximal surplus labor value (ie PROFIT) produced by his "

Sean Walker,that's leadership when ever so slightly politely points the right people are given credit at Tesla
Spunky Spontaneous,Elon is so kind giving his time to do these podcasts I just don‚Äôt know how he does it with his work schedule
Mushtaq Bhat,"He often talks about his concern for our species. He seems to have forgotten his youth, when his primate brothers bullied him. Now he is helping them bully some novel intelligent species in Galaxy after having decimated most of the species of the planet that created them and polluted it beyond recognition.

fieldBee,"@155:15 there was agreement and potentiality for that conversation.   People are still alive and talking.  Step into whatever possibilities that may exist.  Don't assume that you can't make a likely outcome more possible.  Pull out the best possible outcomes.  Where you can, make healthy outcomes more possible.  Do not delay."
David Alvarez,"0 = atom
1 = molecule model
2 = solar system

bobbyleeacn,Such a well rounded interview. You can tell Elon actually enjoyed pondering the questions
paul Wollersheim,the transparency is refreshing . im not use to it. i was thinking whats going with the start but then understood and the end
Maori Rambo,"I think the currency for the Martians should be Martian rock, because of the cost to obtain it and also because of the demand< it would be really low demand but the science behind it to work with aka smelting etc"

LongReachOne,"A simple way to deal with rules and regulations is to check every vested interest before extending/creating one. Vested parties should not be able to petition governments for legal changes. Yes, somehow, Pelosi anyone?"
MVP,you need to be objectively smarter than everyone at everything
Emily Barry,I love how Elon takes full pauses before answering. It show he thinks through before speaking (which is a good lesson for me!)
bat map,"Elon Musk needs mentors, as a source of strength. Whether that be failed experts from the past, hired SpaceX experts working on the problem, or someone that knows the path forward. Although, advice for a path forward would be highly complex, you only learn from past mistakes for clues of how to proceed. If you never look at the past mistakes of other teams or your own team, you will never be able to analyze the source of mistakes and find the path forward to success. Especially, when the problem has never been resolved by someone before, hindsight is 20/20 (looking at history) seems to be the viable tact to discovering something new."

Paublus Americanus AMERICANUS,Mars with the current technology is rediculous and will spell only failure. A base on Phobos or the moon is more than 100 times better for humanity than a waste of resources of a manned Mars mission. A permanent base either lunar or Phobos could return much more investment return than rediculous Mars landing ruining the life of any human trying tilting at windmills to that extent.
John Gordon,How many accidents has there been in the United States since there has been self driving that hasn‚Äôt involved disengagements in Tesla software.
Adel S,I love the way Elon takes his time to think and give the most accurate answer. This way of answering shows how much he values the questions and the interviewer. Thanks Lex for this incredible podcast.
Mike Kilburn,He calls it bananas I call it exciting and brilliant.
Adam Garner,"Outstanding questions Lex. One of my favourite episodes yet and one of the best Elon interviews to date. 

Can‚Äôt wait to see what you bring in 2022."
Mario Galindo Queralt,"One thing no one talks about when it comes to living on Mars is the people who will be born there.  Those people will live with a third of Earth's gravity, so they will probably be very tall and have a very weak skeleton.  It's relatively easy for us to go to a planet with less gravity, but imagine going to a planet with three times Earth's gravity.  Putting things this way, those humans born and developed on Mars, will never be able to come to Earth.  A new species will have been created that will not be able to live on earth.  They will be real aliens.  And this will not only happen to human beings, it will happen to all the animals that we take to Mars.  I think this will be a real problem that we will have to solve."
Mark H,Fridman‚Äôs guests are tops. But listening to his interviews makes me squirm. This one was torture.
real worth,Have you seen the Star Trek next generation episode that shows data the Android trying to be a comedian? We need our Android should be our friends and also give us a lot once in awhile what are they just a machine. Thank you for your time I really enjoyed that episode I'm sure you will too
JP G,Good luck on the Putin call! Would love it to happen but think unlikely now.

gentlemen.  Watching and learning from Ontario, Canada."
Eva G,"It seems to me that Lex run out of gas towards the end. Build your stamina boy, you look almost sedated."
cneuhauser1,"So, father was a nuclear engineer (UofMichigan) back in the 60s. A little disappointed by the push of a narrative by one of the cartoons. More people have died in solar (chemicals), coal, etc. Watch Pandora's Promise... great show."

Elon is an alien confirmed."
Richard Novak,"The guys name that invented the burger as you describe it was John Montagu, the Earl of Sandwich."
infantelitho,"How many times did Elon say, ""rules and regulations""?"
Benjamin Kosto,"Really love how Elon thinks in silence after a good question, always returning a meaningful answer. Like a computer from the 90s.. Takes a little time to load, but it's always right.
Like most, I immediately try to answer, replacing a valuable opportunity of thought with unnecessary distractions, ending up with a less meaningful answer. It is odd though, only because it's a rare trait"
Yvonne Reed,"Are you satashi nakamoto? ‚ÄúNo‚Äù looks down, turns away to have a drink cover face for a moment‚Ä¶

Divert with suggesting the person who developed and inspired the ideas deserves more credit than the coder. The fact that he is versed on who developed those ideas, has previously thoroughly made a study of the economic system and then made millions from helping develop a new on line transaction tech, has released other white papers for the world to use and expand on (hyper loop)‚Ä¶ seems his MO to me. He‚Äôs also not encouraging people to have fun speculating who it is or have fun with it himself. Really pushing that the name of the person isn‚Äôt important. "
lucianofang,I cannot thank you enough for giving Elon time to think after you ask a question. I‚Äôm so tired of these interviewers not knowing what to do with more than 3 seconds of silence and then just filling the empty space with random words.
Ken Seehart,"Wormholes? Unlikely. Any FTL transfer of information from point A to point B violates causality.

However, contrary to popular belief, special relativity is actually not a blocker for one way colonization. Note that the Lorentz factor Œª invokes sufficient time dialation such that the passengers age the amount of time they would have had aged without considering relatively. "
Joe N,offchain transactions with periodic synchronization could possibly solve the dodge coin mars issue
Progderrr,Like a 4 year old telling you his dream about being Tony Stark
Michael,"Without properly knowing if we have a clear path of travel I highly doubt we ever get to Mars , it‚Äôs 33+ million miles at its shortest distance (distance depends on orbit location) and 250+ million miles at the longest, so let‚Äôs just take the shortest distance, almost 34 million miles, that‚Äôs a long trip people, and we have to be traveling at 24900 mph the whole way there, idk just seems rather iffy without the space maps gps app (there is no such thing), I don‚Äôt wanna be a Debbie downer but I‚Äôm just not seeing it."
Ji Zim,"Loved it, lasted 3 minutes, I'm out the mono tone's are more than I can take "
michael Hubbard,I love how Elon musk 100% talks in a descriptive way he puts everything in layman‚Äôs terms for us.
Bill carey,"C compiler wrote our own.  Love that.  There is no argument that autonomy would be way safer,  but only when EVERY vehicle is autonomous would the puritanical obsession with 100% safety occur.  Curious why there isn‚Äôt more realpolitic discussion about advancing the effort with infrastructure (not in the Biden sense but maybe a synchrony) ie., autonomous vehicles get there own designated areas of operation.  Violations by AI drivers, non-AI drivers,  cyclists,  or pedestrians for that matter subject to arrest and fine.  If Musk‚Äôs beautifully designed and realized system competes in the current free for all characterizing US road and streets,  stupid human tricks will inevitably and tragically occur.  Then,  who do the lawyers sue?  Dedicated autonomous areas it seems to me would go a long way."

Iris Carpenter,"Policies and procedures are great as long as they don't become red tape for situations that require common sense. They should be treated as ""yield"" signs...not stop signs...we should always encourage individuals to be creative in delivering solutions and empower them to do so."
Caleb Stump,Great interview.  Love the detail in the conversation.  Fun to see Elon in a good mood.  You can see mutual respect between these two.
Phil Godoy,"There were pauses during the interview where I thought my wifi was acting up, but it was just Elon processing information before answering. His robot head ass."
Grant Thompson,"I believe that people hugely overestimate loneliness as a vector that needs attacking. Most people are really happy with low companion circles given that they aren't being overtaxed in their labors. The modern problem & the wish for death by a lot of people is more related to the relative burden place on each human. There have been a few papers that I can't remember that compared task variance, task complexity, & task intensity through time. The average person today works a hell of a lot more than most people in most eras, including slaves. Defeat the larger vector before you worry about 'loneliness'."

Retired bit Juggler,"Lex,  I love listening to your interviews (multiple times for many and Elon‚Äôs in particular).  I especially love your interviews with Elon because you don‚Äôt waste his rare time.  I am in awe when you can actually stop Elon  for a moment and transport him into delayed deep thought.  These are truly insightful moments when you can see his mind at work in realtime.  I think you managed to get him to that point 5 or 6 times.  Most interviewers squander their incredible opportunity with superficial questions that bore Elon to death.  He has a great mind with few rivals in present and past generations and these rare interviews will be viewed for years to come, by future generations long after any of us are still around.  Thank you Elon and Lex for a very worthwhile 2.5 hours!"

Peter Leid,Mr Fridman you are an amazing human being. This was a long interview covering a broad range of topics with brilliantly worded questions. Mr Musk does nor suffer fools gladly so for you to have him stop dead in his tracks to ponder and think about what and how he will answer is testament to your intellect and ability. Thank you for bringing out the genius for us to get a glimpse... it takes a genius to bring out the genius in others.

CF NEAL,"17:07 -- GUESS, how long, how many seconds, Elon thought, before admitting, he DIDN'T think, in terms answerable of the question proposed by Lex?
    Perhaps ... the question proposed by Lex, drawing (as it seems to me)  upon the deeply spiritual quest uniquely Russian (Tolstoy &c.) -- ""BOG"" thereby boggled his, Elon's mind, briefly, & seems to set him thinking in unfamiliar territory ... perhaps."

FIIR,"44:04 Elon is right on the money here. I work in software development and there is the same problem:
The lines of code is generally increasing over time as new features are introduced (to satisfy the customer), and less time is spent on getting rid of obsolete code (no money in it).
At some point the thing has grown so bloated it becomes easier to start over again from scratch, do a full rewrite and throw away the old project entirely."

Yang Yue,"The interplanetary and interstellar ships must be built in space. Made from materials mined on the moon or asteroids reached by shuttle or space elevators. Massive ships should never be launched from earth. This would be to costly from a material and human point of view. Factories and living accommodations can be built in an appropriate earth orbit or moon base. The same can be said fo all other planets including Mars, giving us the time to explore ways of colonizing the surface of whatever asteroid or planet we may focus on settling. At the same time we can explore ways to project ourselves into interstellar space and beyond. I mean... just saying?"

Cecilia Hong,"Just want to make something clear. Could you help to ask Elon Musk as everything in this universe might interact with each other, and one small matter might make big changes, how he can definitely think that heat death will happen? Can we consider everything in the universe happens just in the old pattern or not, or else, how can we predict it? human beings, as a very small part of universe, will also make difference to the world, and everything changes dynamically, how can he predict so big picture and has he considered this dynamic change? Does he know Chinese culture, or do you know Chinese culture? I admired science and logic, kinds of reasoning thinking,  which comes from our right brain. After a serious depression and schizophrenia, I found my right brain has never been developed or used as I was afraid of emotion so I always suppressed my emotions. After I started to change, I found Chinese classic culture about the world and the universe and also our natural body was right. Our bodies also follow a law or pattern that the universe or other balls run, including the sun. I have strong instinct about this and how to change as per the running of the balls around the earth. We can change ourselves, and we, human beings, can make difference to the environment around, and also to the universe, which might not be easy to predict due to butterfly effect and the interrelationships so long.... I think you might know what I mean."

Joshua Irwin,You wanna know why Elon loves Lex? Is because he's real. Elon knows it's a waste of his time and energy to talk to people who have an agenda. He's trying to get shit done and he can't do it without real people like Lex.

Rin Eric,"Elon! It would only cost about four billion dollars to secure the electrical Grid. It would be in your own interest to pay for it out of your own pocket. That said, it would probably cost about four more billion dollars, which would still not put a big dent in your earnings, to pay for the silver that would shield the 5G towers so that they stop harming people. You may have to DESIGN the shields, but that is your strongest point. Wireless radiation damages some human cells and then spike proteins EMERGE from the damaged cells to EAT the dead cell debris. There are no supernatural floating mucus droplets defying gravity and drying for the sole natural purpose of killing humans but not animals or fish or birds or insects or plants. It would just cost you about eight billion dollars to solve your two biggest problems."
Ollie Tierney,If we colonized Mars in 10 years we would be at war with Mars in 50 years.
Pablo Pacca,"Funny how for me neuralink is by far the most interesting, impactful, crazy, ground breaking venture of Elon's. If anything because it is the one that if successful will instantly redefine all the others.  Yet for some reason it is usually the one that gets the least time and attention during the interviews."

This is no easy task . Having a son with the Asperger perceptual perspective  I know how it can be daunting to provide safety yet keep the mind challenged enough to fly. You did it perfectly, Lex.

DKGNATE,I'm not a huge church goer. But I had a spiritual awakening near death experience that changed my mind. Ever since I've started praying it started coming true. Nothing selfish when praying ever. Just honesty being spoken. And it always comes to fruition.  See how elons previous space shuttles exploded but then he got down on his knees and prayed and his space shuttle finally landed and finished the mission successfully. Just saying.

Jordan Levington,"Best Elon interview to date - congratulations Lex, very impressive."
boeandthelizards,"I think at what Elon is saying is if the government has a monopoly on money and the enforcement of it  basically it is able to corrupt system to the advantage of the monopolization of it's corporation that is the government.  Therefore removing the corruption of the arbitrary ability to make its own rules to enforce itself by the use of blockchain Technology is freedom. The question is how does the public switch enforcement to its own policing? How would such a system exists in the court of accountability? The first principle is that cooperation itself is a voluntary system and the recognition of that needs to be acknowledged with the caveat that everyone has access to that information hence blockchain Technology. Since the ancient Sumerian Phoenician and akkadian Empires all that matters is that the information is recorded, Who polices / records said system?"

Thomas Rebaud,"I love your show generally but this one was disappointing. No hard questions, seems more like you're speaking to your buddy, which is fine but doesn't interest me that much. 

There is reason to have a lot of skepticism regarding Musk and all of his enterprises, be it SpaceX and the feasibility in the medium term to build a self sustaining community on Mars, or Tesla which makes most of its profits by selling Bitcoin or emissions trading, Dogecoin which is just a remake of Litecoin with no recent dev activity on their github repo or Neuralink which many BCI experts say is just outdated tech. If you re invite him next time, please consider asking some of these hard questions. Then again I might be biased against Musk, I don't like his style, a lot of hype and showmanship even though he's pobably a really smart guy. Cheers!"
just1certifiable,"Still wondering how they get threw the dome and Van Allen belt, especially with an aluminum ship?"

thekillers005,signatures for elon musk doing a standup XD
SN KO,I love how Elon goes silent and you can see the gears turning. Lex gives him space to think and answer
Renee Mcgee,"If you don‚Äôt buy Miners DeFi right now, you‚Äôre going to miss out on 1000000X gains when Elon starts taking notice. It solves every problem with crypto that Elon ever brought up."
Om,"I really love the way, Elon thinks before answering any question and then says something worth remembering !! 

Thanks @Lex Fridman for inviting legends and giving us these incredible podcasts!"
Thabo Johannes,Down to earth Bastard Musk is. Wow! You've got to love this guy!
Tamatha Mcchristian,"Miners DeFi token is at 1M MC right now when the true value of the coin is in the BILLIONS, addressing every issue with crypto that Elon ever brought up. This coin is literally insane. Elon is going to tweet about it this week."
Hallow Star,I'm so boggled as to how SpaceX is funded
Nightmare OG,My Mans Elon Musk is a way more complex AI than Mark Zuckerberg Lol he actually looks natural when he laughs and they gave him a Upgrade to be able to make Jokes  lol
big badfuds,The truth is in his logo for those who have eyes to see. 
Mercedes G,"I feel like I‚Äôm too dumb for most of this conversation, but still enjoyed it! I learned Elon Musk loves humanity and I believe him. I‚Äôm grateful to exist at the same time as these two powerful and loving souls. "
John Rutledge,"If it applies , ive noticed that the best archer in the world has the advantage of a lazy eye  , I thought maybe that could have something to do with his ability to compute the arrows vector to the targaet , I think his name is lars or something , he is a danish dood."
John Gordon,"Money only has value to people or individuals that give it value, for example if I don‚Äôt see a particular thing having vale it doesn‚Äôt and can‚Äôt be exchanged for anything."
Pacer96,do we really need money on Mars?
Udummy tutorials,Elon we are not advancing we are declining. attempting to leave the planet is stupid and a failure to see our true purpose
Kevin Hanson,"""So you are saying there is a chance."" lol"
onyxwalkingtank,I love how Elon taking his time to answer questions always catches me off guard and I keep thinking the videos paused. It's a nice change of pace.
Paul Parent,From Russia with .  Your word is your BOND.
Nate Turner,Dude why the hell have we not made a garbage disposal system for laws like Elon said. That‚Äôs the most simple government 101 type shit I feel like. Am I wrong?
Selena Le,"Robotics, AI, Selfdriving, Deeptech,.."
Youbian,"Nature abhors a vacuum. Which is why it will always produce a rebel: an outsider, a contrast to the mundane."

Mr25thfret,"Elon Musk has changed the world and yet, here I am, anxiously waiting to see his stand-up routine.    I'm sure there are many outstanding episodes, but, this is the most important interview I have seen you do, Lex."
Jennifer wilson,Elon is a clown.. dude loves to play!.. hell he made a car that can dance.. best billionaire !! Hands down
Michael Rattray,I truly am great-full for podcasts. If you calculate how much Elon‚Äôs time is worth per hour you would quickly realize how amazing an opportunity we have to listen to these types of conversations.
,"This man is my hero. ""Physics is law, everything else is a suggestion"""
Q Ho,"""I'm not a religious man, but I got on my knees to pray for the success of that Space X Launch...""  A subtle little extra dimension to Elon.  We are lucky to have him amongst us."
deeptanshu divya,When are you gonna ask him about the tic tacs? Even the govt says they dont know what those are
Dave Brewer,"Always love hearing Elon provide his points of view.   Curious that the question on Nuclear power seemed to stay in the realm of LWR and didn't bring up a vastly more efficient version that works at atmospheric pressure, but at high temps of molten salt and thorium converted fuel.  True, only a prototype at Oak Ridge Labs in 1955 ever ran, but the concept was proven (then discarded in the cold world era).   One can only hope small scale, modular nuclear, without the fragility of the current massive grid implementation.  While a NASA engineer rescued the design documentation, I suspect the ability to bring this to fruition lies in someone like Elon.  Wonder if China will develop this, and license the technology back to the US.  That would be embarrassing, but telling."
Ulrik Aakre,1:15:41 ¬´yesh were doing it¬ª. So confident haha
Caly Ireland,Cant wait for this one! Lex is killing it!
cryptogaz,"Elon really is a sound guy just trying to make a difference, and what a difference he‚Äôs made/making Ô∏è"
Miss Nord,"Elon has a great balance btw absolutely straight honest truth and wicked weird and wonderful humour. That Rod Stuart singing in the beginning was top notch his quirky but to funny side on display.  thanks for that one Elon, made my day. Rest of the conversation also delightful intriguing."
Neuri,"watched this today and damn, the stuff about dictators.."
MissWizz,"I love these guys Ô∏èthank you for your hard work, dedication and love happy 2022 and "
David Alvarez,Im not smart enough to make the software right now but music shows the way I have a hunch
Burkhard Dietterle,"Always a pleasure to listen to Lex and Elon. Please continue this series!

I would add to the definition of ""self-sustainable civilization on Mars"" the aspect of Mars City being able to negotiate terms for future supplies and immigration from Earth as well as for shipping whatever goods of interest there are to Earth."
Trixie Faris,I love it when he goes silent for a bit before answering a serious question.... what a marvelous and obvious common-sense habit pretty much none of us peons ever remember to do  
Baconator Mcpooperson,"That moment at 2:30:04 when Lex looks at the camera is worth every second! You made the world a better place with that joke, Lex! Thanks!"
Jack Parker,Ask administrator here if they lost one of those devices that use down on the pathways down there.... I don't know how it got out in space here with a dead man in it. He doesn't even look real.
UnitGFC,"This was awesome to watch, finally a proper technical interview"
Joshua Lewandowski,So it'll open with mob rule on Mars... I'll pass
patkitkat,I like seeing Elon think so hard. He really calculates each answer. Such a neat dude.
Glyn Brookes,The first time in a while I've been fully motivated to listen. Great interview
Leo DeBruyn,"This is one of the best interviews of Musk I have seen-- good questions, plenty of time to think over the answers. I appreciate the patient silence while he thinks. A lot of interviewers are woefully unprepared to interview him and as a result we see him do more explaining than exploring. Fridman, however, does a great job of prepping and it shows. "
Leon Frisch,Brilliant questions.  Really great job interviewing such an amazing mind. I was totally captivated. Thanks Lex.
Vijaya K,"I watched the INSPIRATION 4  documentary on Netflix it was really awesome, I love to watch Elon's videos, he speaks so well, his laughter and voice is just additive. I could watch his videos any number of hours. He is so intelligent."
Artem Bilous,"How is it possible, so many smart people don‚Äôt see how big of a fraud this guy is"
Yung Nietzsche,"Easily best podcast/interview of the year. You're killing it Lex, I really hope you can manage to interview Putin at some point, that would be beyond incredible!"
David Alvarez,Just devalues the actual work in the middle and low class
IRON YOGA,I love the long pauses from Elon. Definition of think before you speak.
tHE HECk,"I love the ""difficult explanations"". 
It all, actually. Thanks!"
Jordan Johnson,Elon is so fascinating and brilliant.  I could sit back and listen to him talk for hours. Such a unique individual.
aeromech93,GREAT QUESTIONS!

Zurich Zurich,@Lex Fridman Please add subtitles in Russian 
Mathew,WE LOVE YOU LEX FOR ALL THE KNOWLEDGE AND GUESTS YOU HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD TO US.
nathan meador,How does he remain so darn humble and loving when he has it all? It‚Äôs refreshing and encouraging. He‚Äôs an intellectual black belt. Entrepreneur Jitsu black belt.
Nathan Garcia,I like how you time stamped the 'quitting is not in my nature' segment. Goose bumps for sure
Ergonomic Zero,Wow! That was a fantastic interview!
JakePaul,That awkward moment you try to flex on your guest by mentioning an upcoming pod with putin but your guest has literally windowshopped ICBMs multiple times with him...lol cringe
Kamyar 1990,The thing I like about Elon Musk is that he takes his time before opening his mouth.
Elrhyes Seyhrle,Love you both in a very human way !
tday99music,"The content that Lex puts out is great! Deep questions, and time to appropriately answer them is why I love listening to podcasts, and this one is top notch! Thanks"
Anna Tait,"I respect the work you put in your videos. I find it truly baffling that all major crypto you-tubers just look at pure wave and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems. It's sort of irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history to invest as so many don't back up their crypto assets. More emphasis should be put into day trading as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 11 btc from day trading with dillon kai's Signal in few weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish."
jake harris,"Thank God for you Lex Fridman ! Many of the great minds of our time aren‚Äôt so willing to sit down and have a long discussion on the record with just anyone. Thanks for being the bridge that allows some of the little people like myself the ability to peek into the minds of so many who should be heard ! Truly , thank you !"
Andrew Sylvester Beasley,"Comparing this to the Joe Rogan show, Elon seems much more relaxed and even a bit goofy. Actually got to see his sense of humor. It's nice to see him talking to someone that can understand him.

If humans want to continue, we really need to get serious about colonizing space. Mine the asteroid belt. Build colony on Mars. Eventually more to other dolor systems."
Zurich Zurich,@Lex Fridman Please add subtitles in Russian 
Bijanzegod,I've read this one book (Space Case by Stuart Gibbs) and Elon is giving me vibes that he wants to start something like in the book Space Case and BOY am I all for that lmao.
Leandro Marinkovic,send animals to mars.. i want to see a fly test of starship with an elephant. that will be a milestone of  the XXI century.
BostonCryptoBoy,Two of the most brilliant minds alive today. What I love is how naturally funny Elon is without even trying. A true sign of a well rounded individual. Thank you Lex. Brilliant interview and well planned.
Willys World,Thank you Lex you are a legend..
gordon quigg,"The first problems that I see existing with a space station on our moon is, how do you protect it from massive bombardment with objects in the universe slamming into the moon. The expense that it takes to get a space station there would be wasted if hit by any one of the infinite objects blasting the moon, as evidenced by its surface, due to the fact that there is no atmosphere there to burn up the objects flying into it before they hit it. Perhaps that is why we haven't gone back. It's unrealistic, uninhabitable, and unfeasible, on any scale. Next, with Mars, all you need there is a sufficient amount of oxygen to sustain life, and a lack of poisonous gases, and toxic materials that can render it, not only impossible, and useless, but unfeasible. Adaptation might not be in the cards dealt there... Hello... Next, if you want to have successful space travel, is it possible to make a space ship like the starship enterprise in the original star trek series. If not, then perhaps we should spent all of that money and technology on saving our own planet right here on earth, where we are already adapted, and we have billions of years of evolution, natural selection to the point of perfect symbiosis, and a planet where all the laws of physics align in our favor, and have aligned in our favor for billions of years, only to have the most intelligent life forms on earth, humans, destroy it, in two hundred short years, and then stupidly spent the last of their technology, resources, and wealth on trying to go somewhere else. I mean really... How stupid can we actually be?"
lakecrab,Elon...heat up a few Dragons bud...we may need to evac the ISS.
Rummel Mendoza,"When Elon pauses for a short period to think of an answer, reminds me when Dr Strange was in a trance looking at the 15 million possibilities to come up with an answer."
Matthew Lee,"17:06 
10010110101010100100101110...
No optimism or pessimism. Get it done. 
-Elon Musk"
Trailer Box,"""I don't care about optimism or pessimism, f*ck that we're gonna get it done."", is the one most important line people should always remember."
Akash Narayan,They way he pauses and deeply contemplates... feels like he's looking through multiple realities all at once like Dr strange and letting us in on the one that doesn't disrupt the current space time continuum
ZoRe Eee,Everytime i listen to Elon speak it sounds like he is being very careful on what he is saying so he doesn‚Äôt leak any information.
MA Allen,"Since Elon recommends the Netflix. I'll watch. Because basic instinct with Netflix, don't trust the propaganda."
Jose Argueta,"Questions for Elon: 1) There is much more physics to discover, so could some ""breaking physics"" help in the discovery?  2) Terraforming is expensive. Could rich countries pitch in?  3) galloping a horse is to speed of light as flying in a rocket is to ""___""?;  4) No-longer-needed regulations can continue in effect by inertia, which is bad; How about regulation coning into effect when needed, which would be good?  5) Do we really need currency in Mars? Incas did not in SouthAm. Perhaps a Transaction Power App/System?   6) How can we get rid of the poor, by giving them a much better education and skills so that they become more productive?   Will Aliens in the moon let us build our own base?"
David Alvarez,Progressive growth comes in standard deviations
muddassar jawed,Amazing discussion Lex. You are indeed a marvellous interviewer.
Steven Humphrey,"Hey Lex, excellent questions... Ya got Elon to quote Shakespeare! Lol. Good job...
Remember, Elon has said that when he was young he'd pondered that, ""What's it all about?"" Question.
""Asking the right questions."".. Is what he came up with....
Good job."
Rambler Andy,"I really liked that point in the conversation [of course, I liked it all] where the talk was about getting things done. I think it was a few minutes before, 16:16 ""Quiting is not in my nature."" And I feel that previous engineers had found the possibility of success for a fully re-usable rocket was remote, and actually not really necessary back in the day, when space exploration was a government funded thing. Once it became a commercial thing it had to be worked out if repeatability could really be done. Then it became an engineering problem. And engineers like to push physics to the limits anyway. And Elon's attitude from "
Ruthie Matteson,"Imagine if we find huge deposits of resources on Mars... which is a fairly realistic idea actually... we will then be able to harvest a great deal of materials to make the mission cheaper.  I'm excited... Elon says he will get a person to Mars in  5- 10 years.  So far,  he's been only late on his promises... he gets it done in the end.   We shall see!!"
Mike Robertson,Wow ! What a pause when Elon was asked about timeline for Mars. He knows how quick and easily stability  on earth can be upset.
tummypierced,No different than any other of them.  Just a different approach.  What is really going on would terrify you.
Ibrahim Hussein,Elon is still winning in terms of being more robotic lol
Leo,Fuck yes the intro with elon wow!!!!
Cybervibe,Just watched the whole thing. Extremely insightful and inspiring. So much you can learn from everything he said. Thank you Lex and thank you Elon!
Adam Peters,Lex is a very good interviewer. He does research beforehand and asks intelligent questions. And he's likeable.
Helene Maurer,Elon is just great    so smart and down to earth ....
Kenan Elkadri,Elon's competitors watching this like 
Oli Gould,The first minute of this podcast perfectly embodies why people actually like Elon Musk
Kathie Fenton,You both need me to ask both of you questions about Love
Richard P,"Balances genius and goofy at the same time so well. Outstanding interview 

""When was the cheeseburger invented... wow"""
Josh Edenfield,"I would love to hear an interview between Lex, Elon, and Putin"
cclevel45,Lmao  this interview is gold
Axiom,Space Daddy don't leave us again 
Matt DeCandia,I think the world should tell Elon thank you . Thank you for staying interested in what you do but most of all thank you for raising so much for ST Judes  and digging deep.  History will thank you for a million years for having your goals and drive but the present should thank you 50 million times that we know of for those children . Imagine how satisfying it must be to use your own space company to give in such a way not caring a bit that the disgusting scum that is our government taking shots constantly at you .
paulbenavidez123,"I‚Äôm not eager to criticize but in my view a civilization that is ready for extra-planetary colonization would first have their home planet in order. 

It‚Äôs not like humans could not achieve a healthy planetary environment and socio-economic equality- free of hierarchical military aspirations which include a nuclear free planet. "
Damir Sladojevic,"Thank you so much Lex , i see how you extract the most essential knowledge from Elon out of your questions. No one in this World could do a better job at that excact task as you do. In conclusion; you do a favour to the entire World, giving your listeners a truly holy grail insight into the mind of one of our times greatest thinker and chief engieers of our time, the most valuble player of the 21 century"
Taiji Star,Lex you are doing great things to humanity!
Cy3rZz,"I evolve everytime I listen to Elon talking, thank you very much for being who you are and sharing your knowledge with us mere mortals."
Scowling Wolf,thanks Lex..love the way Elon thinks
Courtney Puyear,"What I like about Elon is that he has a public image.  He is willing to participate in podcasts and entertain the general populaces curiosity.  What other Billionaire businessman does this?  You don't see Jeff Bezos out there having a little bit of off script fun with podcasters and the public.  This is how I know he really does care about his mission of going to Mars.  To Bezos, his exploration of space is merely a status contest.  His company is there to make him money, and his space exploration efforts are to boost his ego.  They are toys to him.  Elon Musk does not have super exotic cars, mansions and is not out trading up to a hotter wife.  His money goes directly back into all his initiatives.  And all his initiatives are there to help humans extend their existence past what would otherwise be an inevitable extinction.  You can tell how he talks about what he is doing that he is genuinely interested in engineering, space, invention, technology and the continuation of this experiment of human life."
Lee Younger,Lex Fridman in his Russian spy outfit. ‚ÄúHey Elon would you talk to Vladimir Putin if I set it up‚Äù witaf
Venena Religio Est,A legend in his own mind! 
W Hollenbeck,15:25 Elon totally missed the Dumb and Dumber reference....shame.
InvestorNabil,This is the single best podcast with Elon musk. Excellent interviewer. I subscribed. In the past I found him too material. He did great here. Now I‚Äôll go watch the ray Dalio one from 3 days ago.
Josh Stovall,"No thank you Lex, you are the best!"
Shon D Michael,"Elon is seriously cool.  He gets my vote ""Man of the Century"".  No bs."
Donald Jeezy Trump,Civilization could die with a bang or a whimper
Pierre Films,What a time to be alive to witness Elon in our timeline.
Kathleen Phipps,I know they are watching us..aliens..I had one hovering over the school a block away..one hovering over the neighbors house.behind me and one hovering over.my back porch ..I think it was looking in my skylight..I went out side about on my covered porch to have a cig. Got to the steps and looked up..there was a trangle ship hovering right above my porch ..small
jeffraich,Great interview. Elon is such an interesting part of humanity. Throughly enjoyed watching. Thanks to you both.
Terry Briggs,"people are doing all kinds of things they shouldnt be in cars .. like changing the radio station hahhaha, this was a legendary interview well done"
Tom Kelly,"Lex, you have got to follow up with the Putin, Musk interview! That would be so epic."
Casa Cenas,"Love Fridman¬¥s podcast, love Elon¬¥s work....but those memes...jisus christ..so bad. :)"
Laura Freeman,Lex you need to do a sleep story on the calm app in a good way xx perhaps about Elon
Geoff Carr,"Elon Musk ‚Äúthe ideas are the easy thing‚Äù.  Really?  Full self driving next year.  You have said that every year since 2016.  Will enable cars to do better things than James Bond, that humans could never do.  He is so funny.  It‚Äôs not the human that limits what cars do, it is the mechanics of the car.  Level 4 autonomous driving is only permitted in areas of 30mph or less.  So you won‚Äôt be sleeping on the highway.  You are to kind to Elon, Lex.  Guess Lex you feel the pressure like everyone else to not be critical of Elon, the genius who has invented anything."
Dlerious D,I love listening to these two tackle coversation about all the things everyone should be talking about more! The future is now.
Crip McCrypto,"love the questions at the end. well done, man. ""What is love? Baby don't hurt me. . . "" LOL"
kmitchell ferrier,"I wonder if one of the reason‚Äôs Elon‚Äôs conversations with people are so fascinating; is akin to them being like looking in on a conversation between Davinci or Tesla and a colleague or contemporary with whom they feel comfortable speaking with, without having to worry about being understood. I feel a certain inclusiveness that I don‚Äôt think other people throughout history have had the same privilege to experience. Thanks for including us Mr. Fridman."
Jason Millis,"""The machine/ai might as well be human because it looks and sounds human""...
Those who are conscious know there's more to a human being than how he or she looks and sounds, we have souls and we can get in touch with them when we stop being surface minded and surface driven. Those who  do not believe or who have not experienced this basic truth live in internal poverty and are disconnected from reality. Peace be with you."
Kai Be,Can tell Musk generally enjoys hanging out with Lex.
,Let‚Äôs make an intergalactic blockchain!
Aero,"Very Amazing! I am awed, amazing conversation!"
Jack Parker,I must say robots as a companion?... Mortifying disillusionment... For anyone expecting such... They're better off with the dog.
MrVeryfrost,One of the greatest interviews. That even made Musk think occasionally.
Simon Larsen,Elon always talking about humanity like an ex-lover he's forgiven a decade ago and moved on honestly.
imin heaven,national treasure for sure.. If only this guy was born in the US... he could be an amazing President.
ingelise p0ulsen,"realy > I could fall asleep bij theese men talking (  loovely voices )  and still get wat they are ""bringing """
lee dufour,Thanks Elon and Lex!
Ricky Lovenuts,The last part was interesting
David Ajaba,"Only 17 minutes in, and Elon took 12 seconds of silence to answer a question... That's amazing...  He took his time to think through everything, before answering... Most CEOs I know try to answer every question the very second it is asked...
This is amazing... I need to learn to be like this..."
Craig Elliott,"Elon is fascinating as usual. However, if you edit all the ums and errrs out, this is actually only a 10 minute interview.... true story. ; )"
Radek Seky,"That's so scary. ""The future of Mars will be up to the Martians."" Just a little  unsolvable problem creeps up... Who will be the first Martians? It's really sad because the best intentions can sometimes lead to the worst outcomes. This way of thinking could very well prove to be an absolute disaster for the people that decide to move to the colony, and potentially, in a sci-fi-like scenario, to us on Earth as well. The logistic of such an operation would have to be so absurdly grand for it to be successful, that a single billionaire hand picking the first crews and sending them to establish their first government honestly sounds like the worst possible case scenario. We have to resolve this problem as soon as possible. Imagine Bezos chasing Mars as well, landing there second, and saying to "

Joe Rodriguez,Is he elon truely that smart? I m not convinced
Clastr Cloud gaming,"The part from 1:18:00 is really interesting for us because of the latency, jitter, and FPS. It's really an essential problem for Tesla, as well as for us. It's really cool to hear Elon's opinion on how they handle everything. "

Super Hips,"Lex is best suited to interview Elon because 1, he understands science and 2, he too understands the value of humor and knows how important Elon values it as well."
BlueEternities,You both see humans as robots and we're not. You will find that out eventually. The key is perceiving the body as an antenna instead of a laptop.
WakeUpToTheOnePartyOverlords,"Lex mentions Shakespeare quote.  Elon‚Äôs neural network auto loads top 3 quotes in Elon‚Äôs optical interface.  Elon reads aloud.
We‚Äôre already here folks"

Why on earth you wouldn‚Äôt edit this out?"

Went on his knees and pray  that is why,  He always accomplished what he creates with success.
God bless you Elon Musk."
Red Watch,I wonder if the people 500 million years from now will be watching this video.
MoordredP,"Lex, excellent interview. Thank you for asking the questions we would like to ask Elon."
Jeromy Stewart,"""Positive Net Contribution to Society"" I think this excellent advice and would lead to a culture of phenomenal people. This goal is the official position of the countless majority while they unofficially (behind closed doors) seek to extract the maximum amount of resources from society. It's time to measure intent based on actions and productivity instead of a verbal pronouncement of good intentions."
Radek Seky,"Damn he actually had Elon jovial from the start and he wasted it like that man. It doesn't have to be that serious, does it?"
Lord George,"""no source of strength, fck that, we are getting it done"""

AnewDay Ali,"His still like a small child with his ideas and dreams so innocent. It‚Äôs just that, nothing else, everything else just came with it. All his doing is making his dreams come as possible as they can, everything else that came with it came with it he didn‚Äôt chase it.. All his doing is chasing his ideas to became a possibility. That‚Äôs why to me his positive, it‚Äôs like that guy said on joe rogans podcast Jeff, mark are negative energies and Elon is positive.. I agree and why he has the positive energy is what I just said earlier, were as with Jeff n mark have alternative motives and it‚Äôs to be rich n have power n control"

Terryb,I could not believe his response to your question about what strength does he draw on! He thought a long time then said he doesn‚Äôt need strength!
Pia Wintrich,Wonderful
Cosmic composure,by far amongst the best interviews i have seen from lex ...keep up the good work
Hari Purwanto,"Lex, I think you should put a soft background music, so when Elon pauses, everyone will not think that the internet is frozen. :D"
JMar,He has the most calming and soothing voice..
Christopher Neill,Does anyone know the T shirt Elon is wearing?
B,"Lex if you could bottle the  interviews, it would be the end to sleeping pills."
Devansh Agarwal,Wasn't this convo 3hr+ long originally?
Tony,I can't even put into words how great an interview and guest you had.  Elon should be an example to all.  He really has an amazing message in my opinion.
Dan Richardson,"I think Tesla is not a good choice for an EV:
1) Not designed to be repaired by the owner.
2) The designers killed multiple drivers in order to fix bugs.
3) Internal cabin not comfortable and lacks tactile controls."
Tiree Admoltis,"Elon should to take a break from tesla and rockets. And fix our government. AI did not screw our covid reaction up. But im sure it could have helped accurately report the actual cause of deaths. Slowing our economy is the opposite what should be done. Increase the economy to provide the sick, with better health care would be best."

Jennifer Cossentino,I would volunteer to be librarian / curator on Mars.
John Reese,Wouldn‚Äôt it be something if your car loved you back
Zone07,How do we know that previous civilizations haven't extended their lives beyond earth? We are still finding ancient technologies on earth that we can't explain. Look at the pyramids for example; we still don't know their true purpose. What about life on Mercury and Venus when the sun was younger and those planets were in the Goldilocks zone for biological life to thrive?
thepetyo,I just don't get the idea that if civilization would end itself we need to repeat it. What for?
Olle Fj√§llstr√∂m,"I just love the fact that Elon is willing to talk, been a couple of fascinating podcasts now with Joe and Lex "
gustavo moraza,"Monotonous kills! My captions had more tonality and excitement, especially with the long pauses "
King Leonidas," interviews ....... Before the interview began, Lex had to remind Elon about how to  talk into the mic. However, in order for Elon to answer anything accurately. Elon had to link up to the Bubble Network. A faint voice can be heard in the start saying * Please Connect to the Bubble Network. Absalom?""."
Snailtube,"""It will likely happen next year."""
T M,I love that Elon doesn't take himself seriously.
chocograph,Elon has played too much Command & Conquer.

mrliam303,"i think it‚Äôs so interesting that every single person watching this has their own conscious. like, they have their own complex life, and they‚Äôre not just npcs or an idea, but a real person. the way they portray themself is just electronic waves over the internet, but behind that, we are all people sending out those waves. hard to wrap your head around. in the end, we are all connected through the earth. we are really all one.

Masey,"Thank you guys!! Great interview!! 
Sometimes I just want to hug Elon when I hear him talk‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs strong, confident & passionate about life yet he‚Äôs alone inside that beautiful mind. That cannot be easy. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone else sees it but I pray for him all the time‚Ä¶ may peace be with him "

Catherine Jane,"What l love most about Elon...
Elon inspires  on ALL levels.
Most profound & complex interview in which l was able to follow easily.
I could listen to Elon for hours on any subject matter."
Dennis S,Elon is working wonders for inclusion and diversity‚Ä¶.. as an African-American I mean. LOL
Alfonso Anton Romero,"For me, Elon's egomania is unbearable. Don't settle for being the richest businessman in the world. Although he is a great inventor, he constantly attributes merits and discoveries that are not his, he wants to pretend that he is a victim, a self-made man from nothing when he had a privileged education thanks to his millionaire father, even other stories of labor abuses, political intrigues or dirty business of deception. Why, if you don't need it? because he competes with other great polymaths in history. It is his Faustian personality. A great ambition but without deepening and finishing off the details of his projects well. The worst thing is that it is not a unique case, it is another negative media example for society."
Cordell Baker,These 2 A.I Are Next Gen

Imagination Hobbies,Talking about robotic companions is  the wrong direction. You don't bring people together by making them build relationships with robots and phones. Already proven.
U S,What if somebody is not inherently good at anything?
Jeff Wick,I love that Elon takes time to give certain answers so he takes the time needed to calculate what he believes is the best answer
Cate true eleven,48:00 you might wanna think about how to Svhool people about when there were laws and how each era of law played out - then you‚Äôd have a smarter populas that doesn‚Äôt waste life on recreating  the wheel when it comes to how they live together - this is a huge question ‚Ä¶ got me thinking thanks
Rebecca Lotts,I love that you said you got on your knees and prayed. I have been praying for you Elon. The Lord has laid you on my mind and I pray that you will be saved and know the love that Jesus has for you. God has given you a great gift of genius. I know he will answer my prayer for you.

Hollis Anne Mika Krywicki,don‚Äôt forget laws should be easier to erase .. at least as easy as it it to create new laws 
SnowLeopard,"What a great interview Lex, you and Elon are an inspiration!"
Honeycomb Homestead,"Some have strength and some have a will, will is something most have lost. YOU CAN DO IT, WAKE UP PEOPLE. COULD YOU WORK 24 HOURS? If you don‚Äôt know or said no. Then you have strength not willpower. By work I mean moving not sitting."
Ryan Hogue Passive Income,Congrats on interviewing Elon a third time Lex! Your channel is taking off 
Anthony T,"Great work Lex, keep it up..."
Michael Price,"How is it that Lex is able to draw out Elon‚Äôs sincerity in less than 5 minutes?
Both are amazing together! They have an easy conversation - not a grilling Q&A. 
Lex, I have only stumbled on your channel *thank the algorithm for that*, but I‚Äôll wait for more of your awesome journalism in my future!"
Paul Powers,finally! someone gets deep in Elon's head  AWESOME INTERVIEW BEST EVER WITH HIM
Zebra Talk,"If Lex ever has an interview with Putin, I have always had one thought in my mind when it comes to countries that fear the US and its allies, especially Russia and China if those countries would open their borders as much as the US and its allies have with each other. There is no chance of invasion, as the majority of countries would push back from whoever is the aggressor. If this would be the result, then why not stop finding ways to guard your borders and instead work towards ways to open your borders?"
I am Jerry,I was waiting for the word slave in the robot friend section. 
Aziz Imanov,"Lex, thank you so much for coming up with such great and important questions."
Debra Boaze,5 stars & a bit more of hope for humanity. dsue
Raymond Gaither,I hope people recognize this man for the once in a lifetime human that he is. I don‚Äôt believe that he is motivated by money at all. I think he is maybe the smartest man ever and also does all of these things for all the right reasons being that he is just trying to better our lives
treysirs,Always love your shows Lex! The question you asked about the first government on Mars was one I was hoping you'd ask!  Hope you are doing well buddy!
Scott,"Thanks for this very cool interview. You should get Alex Karp on talking about big Data, AI, prevention of terror etc."
,I made Siri speak with Cortana and it was an identical conversation
John Lin,Enjoy this interview. So inspirational.
DARK TRAQUILLITY,i love Elon musk and dogecoin:-).from IRAN.
mark yono,"At first thought, my perception of Elon was that of someone with exceptional management skills and a strong sense of vision. However, upon listening carefully to this podcast Elon Musk has an unusually deep understanding of scientific and engineering concepts in the realm of aerospace and applied AI. Great interview as always Lex!"
Extremely Broad,"Thank you Lex & Elon -- Round 3 - Having attended Teslas AI Conference this past 2021 and read Elons biography among many other things - this talk with Lex ( yet another super brain ) is the best interview I have seen With Elon. No more pie in the sky now that we are all aware that what seemed like ‚Äú craziness ‚Äú on the outset has become a realized expectation- driven by Elons insane ability to harness vast amounts of information and come up with literally out of this world products.  So insightful, so articulate and clear. Very well done Lex and Elon."
Joshua Morrill,Elon has the greatest mind of several generations. We're witnessing greatness to 10 power.
Mascha Jelic,"Is there a license for using the name of Nikola Tesla? Martin Eberhard came eventuelly up with the name. I happen to be from the Tesla family. He was treated badly in the United States and past away in a hotel very poor. I think it‚Äôs not in Nikola Tesla‚Äòs interest and his families,what is done with his name. I doubt all these ideas,due all respect,of Mister Musk. It‚Äôs Hybris. One Love,Mister Fridman."
shootermcgavan,Great questions. Interesting thought with Elon's garbage cycle system for laws & regulations. Some laws then could be counterproductive now. Needs to be talked about more.
David Alvarez,"Could be phisical prescense, with new pilots whom follow a process of traveling selecting. Omeostasis

Michael Behrns-Miller,"Re Raptor, Elon is so patient to explain things that are so complicated in ways that are as easily as understandable as possible.  Every teacher should study his explanation as a gold standard.  Awesome."
OJ9779,"Lex: What is your source of strength? 

Elon: I am a robot. I am the source of strength."
Luke Trader,"Awesome interview with some deep, personally challenging questions for Elon. Thanks Lex and thanks Elon for opening up a little. <3 <3"
Edmund Bippus,"Love this part.  Anticipated other road users mistakes as we all know, if you have driven on the road long enough, is the biggest problem to overcome! .  The concept works perfectly if people don't feck it up .   Nothing is perfect in an inperfect world.  If all cars were autonomous then there would be NO accidents so to speak,  l still hope l can drive a GT40 in the future, the car one could and did hire from a showroom and take it to the track and win "
orangemotherprincess,I wonder if Mars has a 1% life threatening chance event happening every year.
Petar Atansov,I never saw a smart person next to elon
leo van der linden,"Wouldnt it be cool to eventually have like formule 1 style race with a driver versus autopilot, or maybe formule 1 where all the cars are AI but the companies all have theire own code."

Victor Philip,"""However things were done, it is the history that happened.  You can't, sort of, erase that history, unfortunately.  You can just become better in the future."" -Lex Fridman"
Payton Lee,I like how Elon Musk doesn't actually understand smart contracts! Fascinating how such a smart man can also have holes in their knowledge. Why Lex doesn't jump in to enlighten him is beyond me.
Gianna Lang,"I like the interview it is always good to listen to Elon‚Äôs beautiful voice. 
‚Ä¶I definitely think he is already someone that will be part of history.
I wish him the best of everything‚Ä¶"
Moni M,yes - only advanced (also returning) ROCKET ENGINE...... true .   but what about anti-gravity? - guess you had to comply to MJ12
John √òstensen,Great interview. Elon says autopilot will be superhuman. Would be cool to see what a superhuman AI could do with Plaid around the N√ºrnberg
Pia Wintrich,You are the best.
Fireplaces,Let‚Äôs go lex!! Thank you so much for this!
Michael Hadac,I like Elon's strength! He must have nerves of steel! Wish I had his money and ambition earlier in life.. He is a Great man for humanity..
YeahRight Whatever Golden_Fire,"God!!
How he goes from CEO to the goofiest goof and then back to serious CEO, in such quick fashion, is just absolutely amazing."
Joan Pahls,I do believe that is possible with a quasar space s a i l it is a ship you know now think about it up a spiral wormhole warping matter I mean of course I don't know if it will work but if we can create different alloys can we manipulate the visits to make it work like a space elevator? Go to Titan for lunch be back in time to pick the kids up from school of course it has to be physics but can we make it for a better use in a different way what we already have?
M.,Mythical interview. Thank you LEX & ELON

tyler roost,I can't wait to rewatch the one with your dad next. Can't wait until we can create a joined dialogue.
Majkel B,The time when there is looong silence in the conversetion with Elon I love the most. I can feel milions of thoughts going through his head to analyze the question and the answer  way deep than we can even imagine..
Anthony Dowling,The Elephant in the room >man never landed on the Moon <
Mitch McTurtle,Dude Lex you absolutely slayed this interview thanks man
Miss Surreal,Elon Musk for Bae: 2023
jay2aussie,"These 3 interviews by Lex, and hopefully more to come, will be a primary resource for studying Elon decades and centuries from now by students and scientists around the world long after we are all dust."
DeetOpian Sky,"I found the introduction to the questions in the Humans on Mars chapter interesting. Why wouldn't we start cutting IN the middle man and build vehicles on the Moon? Overcoming the gravity of the Moon with each launch could potentially far offset the cost of creating manufacturing, especially if using raw materials from the Moon for production."
Sarth Patel,"This should've been premiered in theatres, at least in tech universities! It's really an amazing movie."
Dario D,trying to invade the Caucas  and Eastern  Europe  never works out  well  :))))

James Cox,Wow. I had fun watching that. Elon has a breadth and depth of knowledge that is clearly genius level.
Bertha Rico,Me gustar√≠a que lo subtitularan en espa√±ol. Gracias.
Sandeep Dmello,Lex sounds like he's stoned af
Vytautas ≈†audys,"If you want to move through space faster than the speed of light, like space itself does and if that's possible - it should also be possible to become space material for a period of time (while you move). That way you wouldn't need to move space which I think sounds harder rather than becoming space material."
Hasnain Lakhani,"dude, amazing questions..."
Frosty boi,"As an accounting and financial management grad, I'm always very impressed by just how well rounded Elons' knowledge is in regard to economics and finance let alone physics and engineering."
HODL crypto,"Powerful, exciting, humbling interview."
Ryan Auty,What a brilliant mind.  I can't justify his views of going to Mars but after seeing this it's explained his perspective well.  He seems to be perfecting material logistics and maybe the space odyssey is just a stepping stone to build capital/infrastructure he needs to change the world.  I was very excited to hear his views on nuclear.  Maybe some-day he could change our power grid to small scale nuclear plants using all the knowledge and infrastructure he's created with these endeavors.

,"Honestly, the documentary he mentioned made me feel like a hopeful kid again. 

I was extremely happy for all 4 that got the opportunity to go up there. They were actual genuine people. They didn‚Äôt act like heartless robots answers bogus questions. The showed full emotion and excitement. "
Frost,I relate to Elon when he said he doesn‚Äôt think that way when lex asked how he finds the strength and courage to move forward. I‚Äôve never understand or related to people that are obsessed with meaning and morals and motivations. I just do because I do.
Jason Dinault,"Put this on to drift off to sleep. Two hours later I‚Äôm still listening. Another half our to go then another hours worth of processing what I just listened to. Elon sucks, keeping me up this late."

Ian Durr,Elon Musk is the best!  I would enjoy working for him. Thanks Lex and Elon
Analogopithecus,"Admirable work by Elon Musk to develop self-driving cars but it all seems to ignore the fact that some of us enjoy the act of driving enormously. 
I like the feeling of being in control and being able to manipulate things in my world to achieve certain goals-such as navigating from A to B, safely and efficiently, I really don't like being a passenger in a car at all and believe that owning one of Elon's cars would be depressing and frustrating."
Kyle Weaver,Only about halfway through the video and I've been completely blown away by the way Elon's thought process works. He is literally a genius. Truly inspiring!
Dusk,"When Elon says best case 5 years, worst case 10 years in terms of humans on Mars... absolutely mind blowing"
JD Danzig,One of the few rocket engineers to actually engineer a rocket
huntertownsend21,Elon talks so much and yet says so little
Saswat Satya,Elon is very selective with his interview lex podcast is one of them
Peter,The closer you are the sexier you sound 
Joshua Penny,"Look how far AI has come, 2 robots speaking to each other effortlessly. Beautiful"
Alexander Teterkin,Great interview! 
Carlos Felipe Franca da Fonseca,Elon pauses for almost 20 seconds to answer many of the questions. This is a great lesson to all of us: we never need to rush just for the sake of an answer.
A Flight Of Bumblebee,"Why only 40% vote to remove a law?...that seems odd , if the 60 % majority of people want a law to stand that it can be voted away for the happiness or benefit of a lesser quantity of people?!...."

Lazarus Basilio,"Elon and Lex said once he would talk to Putin, lets cancel them! Sorry my maggot brain jumped the gun."

Jarred Davidson,"Best Elon Musk podcast yet. It is hard to ask good questions, and you did just that, Lex. Bravo!"
Corey Mason,What happens when carbon based (tangible) AI devices figure out how to move the space in front of them? 
Krypt Design,This interview is incredible and I haven‚Äôt finished yet. I keep getting hairs stand up and zaps in my head. I wish I had this sort of drive and motivation.
Diane,Elon some people can't relate its because they can't think outside the box. I feel you are brilliant and I pray you stay on the conservative side dont let putin drive you away. Love you!!!

Tedward,"As a huge fan of Elon, it's so frustrating to be excited about his efforts and have a circle of people that want to focus on silly shit in his life. People that are really brilliant,  but swayed by dumb media and (probably) a subconscious fear of intelligence they can't understand. "

Joseph Marquez,Musk is the only guest that makes Lex's intellect seem absolutely pedestrian by comparison. It must be quite difficult for Musk to even deal with regular people at all.
YC Liew,"I think Elon missed out on 1 specific feature of cryptocurrencies when he talked about inflation/deflation. In their current form, Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, strongly rely on their value in form of USD. Even Tesla can't accept Bitcoin/Dogecoin without referencing the price of Tesla's products sold in USD. Inflation/deflation are both irrelevant until its widely accepted."
Viraj Shah,cant believe tesla is also sitting and tagging those images. what a waste of talent. there must be some way to automate that process?

Brooks Kioschos,‚ÄúWhat even is a name‚Äù most relatable question I‚Äôve ever heard
Rimbawan Gerilya,I have less doubt the billionaire side of him was never a goal but a mean to overcome engineering/entrepreneurial problem. Or just a side effect of his endeavor. I like it when he said a successful mission gave him relief instead of elation. It could mean that he didn't take all the credit and kept his ego in check.
zeppelincheetah,"The problem with democracy is the peasants are largely uninformed, agnostic, and foolish.  Direct democracy is fine for very small groups (say, 500 or less) but much more than that even in the absence of representatives will inevitably lead to propoganda through the press pushed by special interest groups to control the masses into voting on their behalf.  Rule by a benevolent monarch is a much better system and contrary to popular belief monarchs aren't all despots - historically they have ruled with the populace's best interests at hand.  Hereditary monarchy is vastly superior to the much more corruptable and nefarious form of democracy."
pTdeady,When he was asked when a human can be landed on Mars he began to think of it as if he had never done it before . And then another lie comes out :)

Edmund Bippus,"Love this part too.  Only in the way that as a young teenager l read    the dam busters and developed a fascination with war fighter development of aircraft.  The first get fighter ect...... l was in love with it an read way too much about it as a kid.   V1    V2    doddle bugs     vonbraun was part of my youth.  Shauberger, Tesla, are suppressed  still today,   electrogravitics, implosion to name just two.  I was working on hydrogen injection to either run or supliment feul efficiency back in the 80s "

He couldn‚Äôt even explain what love means to him 
The question made him perplexed

Gregoria Paniagua,"My first time getting to know Elon Musk here  He has a good sense of humour.. I notice he did not have a true love yet, hope God gives him something money can not buy that is true love Ô∏è. What is love? Love is not a feeling. Love is a choice that we make to take care of a person and to be there forever for them.  In the first language BC. Love is = to give. In Gods language love is also to give. That is why God gave his only son for us.  Who is God? God is Spirit and he is here with us. John 1:12 We can be born in the Spirit. .How can we be born again .? You can ask me and I Will tell You step by step. Do we have super cool powers? yes after we are born in the Spirit again God give us super cool bodies and we do have super powers.

Scott Andrew,Wow. Lex was able to capture the sheer brilliance of Elon so well. One of the best interviews out there.
Frost,I think Elon is smart but I think it‚Äôs weird when people describe simple things that everyone knows in big words to make themselves sound smart.

Kyle Stricklin,Lex. So much applause for you. This is one of the best 2 hours I have ever watched. So much respect and love for what you and Elon are doing for this world.
KittenWorld,"How do humans recognize distance to an object. Its by focusing on the objects. When our eyes focus on closer objects, far away objects get blurred. If Tesla is detaching lidar sensors, there must be a way to recognize closer objects. May be using closer range lidar or cameras with different depth of field. Tesla probably wont recognize closer barriers that aren't in the image net."
Gail Alfar,"Dear Lex,
I live in Texas, and I‚Äôm extremely fascinated with Tesla and SpaceX.
This interview was excellent, and filled in some of my gaps in knowledge.
I watched it once, and I‚Äôm planning to watch it multiple times."
Pinguin Henriquez,Your potcast is so interesting.  Yall talk about a lot of  think I was thinking checking out when I was 13. A lot I red or seen ...a lot of people around me don't understand or even think it's among us. I feel like a lot people are sleeping...and are addicted to phones games TV....they like sombies....I love to learn things every day if I can understand what your world is were you live in. The world is changing...people need to adapted to it...it will never be like it was back then... AI age is among us. Ebens and stuff
Kiel,Maaan you have done really extraordinary work interviewing Mr Musk there. Gj
Chris chrisi,They ask him questions like heas an alion they just found and asking questions aso heas gonna die in 1hr...an trying to get what they can out of him before he vaparates.
Dave Smith,17:03 the ability to maintain that silence is impressive
Kathie Fenton,There is a good comedy show back here in Dallas you should do it.
Vocivi,"Incredible! Thanks, Lex! You did a wonderful job picking questions for this interview of our most important figure in the world at this time."
mikespg,If you play this video in fast speed it seems like Elon is talking at almost normal human speed.

Lord Richardson,"Lex does the best Elon interviews by far. ive heard many people interview Elon and no one comes close to Lex. Even Rogan, who I view as the best of the best in terms of interview ability, asking the right questions etc. Lex surpasses that with Elon."
Solar Wizzo,"Elon did not tell, WHY Germany had bad Fuel during WW2. About 50% of German fuels during WW2 were products from ""hydrated"" coal, not oil. Something he should note, when he makes statements in public interviews. Actually he might face a similar problem, when CH4 is synthesized on MARS for STARSHIP return to earth. Just a little impurity might influence a high performance engine."
Darko Reljic,Currently reading the Condensed Version of the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Will update comment in 35 years to see if I turned out similar to Musk.

Brooks Smith,Hey Lex can you recommend any good books about first principles from a philosophy standpoint?
Martin Hardoy,Thanks!
Karel Hoogendoorn,What a great conversation/interview this is. Lex is capable of asking questions that tickle Musks' brain and Musk himself is very enjoyable to listen to. His capacity to talk about different subjects √°nd explaining them in a way that keeps everything understandable is fantastic. His thoughts about digital currency on Mars and the problem of the 20 minute lightspeedgap had me scratching my head in awe.
Jan Kade≈ô√°bek,"2:31:45 Interesting how they completely ignore the fact that the actual happiness decreases as the ""quality of life"" increases. Also funny they are talking about getting food not being problem now (and that stupid argument by Musk about having obesity instead), while around 1 billion of people are currently suffering from food deprivation. The whole interview is just scratching the surface - each topic opens so many important questions, but for whatever reason the interviewer never asks them. Looks like more an Elon promo than anything else."

Jonathan Adami,"Look, I love Elon for a lot of things, but I'm right now listening to the law thing and the logic behind it baffles me ""It should be 60% to add a law and only 40% to remove it"" wouldn't the 40% alway wait for the law to be ratified and then just remove it? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø It should just be the same, if most people agree to remove a law than it goes away. I liked the host's idea of garbage collection tho. You vote something and every so often, you check ""hey, this one is X years old, anybody cares about it now? Nobody? ok gone..."""

Double Vision,"Digital Currency is the end of resource allocation in a free, Laissez-faire economy."
Rod K,"We should put Elon in charge of finishing the high speed rail in California. If he can do that, let's blow money on this pie in the sky idea of going to uninhabitable planets without new physics and technology to actually do it. Maybe we should terraform places on earth so that we know how to do it on another planet. Meanwhile, the profits keep rolling in for all these higher ups in this space race to Mars. And by profits, I mean your tax dollars that could be spent elsewhere on other things. You know, here on earth where you live."
Nate,Thanks!
Marc Slavin,"Super interesting interview. Great questions were asked and answered. Robots, rockets, Mars, and neural networks‚Ä¶"
Alexander Teterkin,"Hmm... There is something I know better than Elon Musk :)) Mainframes are most modern systems we have today, actually: they use fastest processors, they use most modern crypto-engines, they have best security (Encryption everywhere), they enable most modern Cloud-native development (thanks to Kubernetes, OpenSift and containers technologies). And yeah... they have support for software built years ago (but it's good point for banks). And they are not expensive at all if you get all the benefits of mainframes and calculate ROI. Banks cares for money and they keep buying mainframes (not because they cannot emulate COBOL in VM, but for reasons I mentioned above)."

kungfu mcgee,28:05 I thought it was buffering lol
Norman van't Hoff,"Brilliant podcast, but (humbly, in the knowledge that both of you are magnitudes of order smarter than me) may I challenge you on one small point. Genghis Khan ran a meritocracy (name another in history) and and innovated a whole bunch of things we take for granted today. He granted freedom of religion throughout his vast kingdom and, according to an excellent and seemingly very credible book, 'Ghengis Khan and the Making of the Modern World', he treated his subjects well by the standards of the day.. Caveat, as long as they accepted Mongol rule. He was an extraordinary man with a strong sense of justice  but he always gets a bad rap. I don't think he deserves to be lumped in with sociopaths like Hitler and Stalin."

dooma flatchie,"I wish Elon had responded to Lex's question about black holes and faster than light travel with regard to black holes rather the speed of light itself. If you consider how long FTL travel takes to get from Point A to B, if do can get from Point A to B without actually traveling through space, e.g., a black hole, for all practical purposes you are traveling faster than light speed."

HashTagRealName,"The point of smart contracts is to build decentralised systems. Computerised/automated execution is a perk, but not the entire point.

Corey Mason,It seems reasonable to find a way to capture/recover methane from natural sources and fuel SOMETHING with it. ...Why lose free fuel?
MP,"No questions on UAP's? Come on, you ask everyone and not the chief engineer for SpaceX?"
Muse California,"I‚Äôm concerned.  I‚Äôve been interested and a low key fan of Musk for a while.  But stop for a second and notice his potential for a lack of morality.  Elon Musk is obsessed with surpassing humans and has no limit.  If you listen to what he‚Äôs foretold, what he‚Äôs working on now, and when he takes those long drawn out pauses, like at 1:39, he‚Äôs pretending he hasn‚Äôt thought about being the leader of robotic armies.  But he has."

Hentsy Designs,Musk is so relax with fridman.
DeetOpian Sky,"I wonder at times if a coriolis ramp/different shaped vessel wouldn't be a better idea. Newton's sketches defining gravity and achieving orbit depicted a canon firing a canon ball and the best modern science can come up with is an arrow being fired up into the sky. Being uneducated, I can only assume I just don't know enough about physics to have an opinion on the subject."

Raku R,"you are doing a great service by getting Elon's thinking and vision across to masses! He is single handedly pulling the humanity across great filters - multi-planetary species, living symbiotically with AI - . A future episode completely dedicated to Elons' problem solving approach would be much appreciated!"
Sydney Simon,"Lex thank you so much for all your hard work, these conversations you‚Äôve done with Elon are by far the greatest in my opinion! Again Thank You for sharing."

Keith Police,"if only Musk sycophants were as funny as the clown himself, what a laff riot that would be."
Joseph Van,"Musk is a 21st century incarnation of Ben Franklin. Franklin was a true Renaissance man. He  organized the U.S. Postal Service, he invented the lightning rod, Franklin wood stove, bifocal glasses, the glass harmonica musical instrument. He created and then published the Old Farmer's Almanac and Saturday Evening Post magazine. As ambsssador to France, he convinced the French to participate on our behalf in the Revolutionary War. He helped author the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. His scores of wise sayings, such as a penny saved is a penny earned, are still cited today, 250 years later."

I know you are already on that track  but at least make a limited edition as in to order, super sexy, super fast vehicles that only the super rich or healed can afford.   May not sound good but a new revenue stream. .  Over time I've learned to love your work and more to the point, your humanity. "

Information is contained in energy, or is energy, thus the information money contains allows you to direct the energy or others to your goals.

Barak Rigbi,The 20 seconds of silence before Elon answered the question ‚Äúwhen we will put a human being on Mars‚Äù was the most powerful moment in this conversation.
Zebra Talk,"What does it mean when someone claims to not be a ""religious person"", in a very stressful event in their life says they were so stressed that they prayed? There is an obvious conflict with such statements as ""I am not religious"", because religion is a human response to belief. Regardless of what the belief is or is in. I would rather people that claim they are not religious just settle on what they do believe in. Whether it is money, humanism, or some deity."
Don T. Panic,"You're shifting from strictly structured questions, to a more fluid, conversational type of interview.

BlueSkyleaf,"Very good interview! Although some of the later questions interestingly pose a greater challenge to both lex and elon even though they have rather obvious answers. So far from accumulating all knowledge about intelligent humans I could during my life, I would define general intelligence as the absence of stupidity and the ability to ""correctly"" create, question, expand and adapt ones believes and biases after being confronted with new information or by  reviewing them. Both Lex and Elon struggle with emotional intelligence and correlating it to human physiology which seems to be rather common for ""intelligent people"". I suppose admitting how limited and ""simple"" humans are and comparing them to ideal potential (intelligent) existence is inherently ""unwanted"" by evolution as it prob leads to a decrease in average mental health, drive and thus survival probability.

sriram lamsal,I have seen the whole in two days in two stretches. Coming over here everytime to get pop references for technology. Love you lex from india. always searching lex when AI lectures in mind hands down!!
Maggie Mae,"Musk Go to Space, but what is Space, where are we exactly"
Carlton Miller,Very informative and insightful interview.  Thank you very much!
Nas Ali,MIB interviewing Robot.
Jeff R,This interview was inspiring with the many concepts that made me think of and give me wonder. It's great to learn about complex ideas and to apply them to my small world.
Topher Dean,"""Is it still expensive?  Then economy of scale is not the issue.""  When I first saw the Cybertruck, after my initial shock, my first thought was, I bet this design was the cheapest to manufacture.  There are no curves, so cutting and pressing is much easier.  All the glass is flat, I can't even begin to estimate the cost savings of that.  Instead of lowering the price though, he decided to use the savings to make the glass super shatter resistant.  The savings on not having curves in the body panels, went into 30X cold rolled 304 stainless.  For me, there's beauty in that, form over function, especially in a utility vehicle.  Brilliant."
Steven Wood,"Lex great job. Elon Thanks for making it possible to understand. And doing everything you personally can do to help everyone to move to the next step. All support to both of you known and unknown. Like Lex said in the start, right know things are pretty shit stained.
So thank you."
MidgetshootingGunsAk,So why did tesla use its own tesla plug in america üá∫üá∏ and not allow other EV s to use his charging hubs.  Euro teslas where built right and have CCS .  Damage is already done reason everyone hates tesla. Euros and american EV drivers all hate teslas and will never buy one.  We would way rather have the Porsche EV that is quality and fast any day over a ugly tesla that looks like a wannabe mercedes fast but NO quality
umcosta,"Spent my life wishing to lived when humans landed on the moon. Luckily, I might see us landing on Mars."
Mama Bear,Lol! Those aren't going anywhere
Ryan Crozier,This interview is awesome on so many levels.
Gary H,"God I love Elon, what a hero. Honestly he will be remembered for ever"
Dustin Walker,"Lex, this is one of the best conversations with Elon that I've ever seen. It showed more of his personality than any other. Love all of your stuff but this is one of your best, thank you!"
Kai Be,"Musk has single-handedly giving me hope in humanity. I cried numerous times with joy and felt the emotions his team did with every success and failure of his Falcon 9 rockets, culminating in the delivery of both humans and cargo to the ISS."
Osama Abbas,I hope that terrible person (the charlatan of our era) is paying you good money to have him in your podcast multiple times to talk about his usual BS.
MaT,"Mmmm... Radiation...
Where do cancers come from? Where do autoimmune diseases come from? Etc, etc. 
The answer is that the origin is difficult to trace and it might well be excess radiation.
Someone told me once that his job was filling a river with ducks, because it was by a nuclear plant and the ducks would die regularly. So his job was to make everything look normal. Just saying. "
Paul Parent,Seriously COOL blues brother
GyongyGyongy,Man of action or man of silly chants?
Evelina,2 and a half hours of Elon and Lex 
Blake Black,Elon should run for president
tam hewitt-baker,"Currency that has scarcity indeed does make people want to hold on to it so that it's value may increase, but then that gives greater access to wealth and I imagine a world where two factors meet.  That natural resources be used in as best a way as possible bringing the market back to making products that last a lifetime and that disposable production is made redundant. Couple that with accumulation of wealth should in my opinion help make a wide reaching culture that cares about quality over fast paced disposable products as well as a mind set that is more conservative with resources. I hope that made sense, I basically just wrote as I thought through the concept."
joe b,LEX'S END GAME IS PUTIN ON PODCAST
MrDavid,"I continue to appreciate Elon‚Äôs humility. He has much he could brag about, but chooses not to."
Curly Fl,"I think in the main time we have to maintain our planet  before we spend are time and money on things what are still will be there we have to make our room first we have brainpower technology money , pick up people from the streets give them food jobs healthcare peace shame on us still people suffering, how we can go to a party whit a dirty shoes ‚Ä¶"
Formidable Frank,"I love your guys relationship because you can tell there is a true friendship between you. Between Lex, and the wealthiest man in the world. It‚Äôs wild to me that Elon is so willing to engage in these podcasts and seems to enjoy them. Thank you for this "
R. Kupyr,"A visionary. Wonderful to hear his thoughts on engineering, physics, space travel and his overall hey-I'll-try-that! attitude toward life. It's also always a good reminder to see that a great skier isn't necessarily a great basketball player (even though her standards might be higher than an average person's). Smart move, Lex, to quickly move away from Elon's much less impressive thoughts on foreign-language acquisition and nuclear energy."
Bridge,"The belief in God, in the meaning of life and the Hereafter where we are all going to end up in, IS the ONLY hope.
Then the acting for this goal."
Selena Le,My favorite Firechat
gordon quigg,"Ok, at one hour into this video, how do you account for all kinds of unpredictable situations, where there are criminals going at 100mph, in a police chase, and running stop signs, and trafic lights, and freeway lanes. Or how do you account for tornadoes, or snow and ice scenarios. Or country roads out in the middle of nowhere? Or drunk drivers asleep at the wheel, veering into other lanes. Or the person driving an autonomous vehicle falling asleep at the wheel in one of these adverse situations? The only way it would work is of every vehicle on earth is plugged into the same system. Until then, it will never work. So Mr Elon Musk, who doesn't want any government intervention of any kind. How are you going to force every vehicle on the road, from cities to country roads and off roads to submit to this kind of locked in control? Good luck with that one...."

Kronan Barbarian,"My theory is that time-space distortion works in a similar manner to submerging a wet hand into molten metal  where the sudden conflict between the the water and the heat creates an instant gas envelope, preventing the hot liquid from burning the hand for a brief moment. Anti-gravity in this case is like the cold hand being submerged into the molten lead which is representative of normal time space and what allows an object to travel faster than light in the anti-gravity state is that it is caught behind the barrier created between the conflict of gravity and anti-gravity which means it moves through a friction-less space."
Jamie Cannen,Elon you the savior of earth and humanity keep up the good fight you rock
Super Hips,"You killed it Lex, if I could subscribe twice I would"
Mark Pirola,"Thankyou Lex for providing thoughtfulness into this interview process. My mind has questions arising from your questions ‚Ä¶ and you find the time to at least pose these questions and tease out implications from what is being stated.  Elon surprised me a little on his Nuclear Energy views. I get clean. I get radioactive waste can be contained. Issue is the long term containment and humans. The dirty global coal station count is around 8500 plants at 37% of global energy supply. Nuclear is 444 civilian plants at 10% of supply. So if we ramped up nuclear to say 50% we would have a global plant count of say 2200 plants at current technology level. I fear humans, we make too many mistakes and there is too many maligned groups that would not hesitate to turn Nuclear plants into ‚Äúdirty bombs‚Äù. So yes please, dismantle dirty coal. But replace with renewables and storage. We can do this. To Elon and your net plus contribution to humanity (understated) Thankyou!!!"
hunor6,Imagine people in a hundred years on Mars listening back to this conversation about government structure suggestions from Elon.
David Alvarez,"Like me time is running out
Even tho the math won‚Äôt give power it‚Äôs so called crown which I found stupidly 
Focused in the object logos not the practice"
Elijah Roberts Cinema,Elon sounds like he's giving a tutorial on a world building survival video game. I love it.
Robert Namen,"1st law , protect thy self ,2nd law, protect others as long as it does
not conflict with the 1st law."
Clay E,"Just superb,no fluff,2 intelligent people having insightful ,informative conversation,Elon really seems to enjoy answering Fridman's questions"
Johan Lund,"Great Interview thanks. Lex has really progressed as an interviewer. I saw him a year ago or something, he is not scared now not to seem clever, and he lets his guest shine. Fantastic work!"
Rich Waight,What an amazing conversation! So interesting to listen to you both <3
Jack Parker,"Of course say whatever I said ..
as a proud American... Well good or bad hyphenated American... America's must make each and everyone of us... Measure up to quality and not just complacent quality.."
Alexander Berglund,"Great pod, Elon really shone in this one! A bit shaky with Lex trying to explain the memes, but still great"
Krys,Lex speaks to fast !..today
Jeonggukie1997,"i can listen to elon all day , so much to learn and the questions lex asks are on point."

Matt foreman,"Simply incredible interview, thanks gents"
McRobot,Luis Lunch in New Haven CT is credited with the first burger.
Beau B,I love how Elon started out the interview with such personality
LS TV,"#ElonMusk

If a true democratic society were to be transparent would not then peoples lives also require complete transparency? I.e. the abolishment of privacy?"
Paul,Fascinating to watch these two amazing minds converse. Great interview and great channel. You got me. Subscribed. :-)
Klaus Wagner,Fantastically interesting. wish I were much younger to have good time to study what came up!
Sylo,"I was gonna sleep but this master piece came out, amazing content as always!"
Lost Child,"I question whether we went to the moon in the first place based on the circumstances and difficulties Elon Musk is having with his endeavours.  They say we went to the moon over 50 years ago, so why is it so hard to replicate?   hmm"
Patrick Karnwie,With God everything is possible
Philip Campbell,Good for everybody that he's not evil
Jack Parker,I must say and maybe I shouldn't.... For fear of creating self-consciousness... orator has seem to transcend all limiting identities.... But I can say quite honestly... Being Russian can be quite impressive...
Richard Smith,Elon wildin
Hey it‚Äôs Anthony,Nice to see Elon be interviewed by someone intelligent.
Travis Fitzwater,"Smart Contracts will become pervasive.  Elon could roll out a flagship computational paradigm to instantiate a Smart Contract Approach to almost every conceivable societal interaction.  The Wolfram-Musk Method to sort out  the problem of sorting out misunderstandings and otherwise intractable conundrums that serve no purpose other than to operate as sand in the gears of swift, peaceful and orderly societal progress."
TheShorterboy,"The US constitution showed it is government that needs limits, not people; no law should survive more than 2-4 elections unless it's voted on again and government needs to be constrained."
Roman Romashko,"We need wait... So, it is looks as it is over."
Geoff Carr,"OMG Lex, honestly thought you were smart.  How did you listen to Elon talk crap.  Elon says the brain paints in the missing bit caused by your blind spot.  Lol.  That‚Äôs why you have two eyes, it blends the images together, it just not just compute the missing data and fill in the gap.  Cones for colour, no cones around the edge of your eye so the brain fills in all that data to that is missing.  You can‚Äôt make this stuff up, only Elon can.  This is the man with Neuralink.  And he doesn‚Äôt know how the eye and brain works.  If cones don‚Äôt provide data to your brain you don‚Äôt see colour.  The brain doesn‚Äôt go, oh, I ran out of cones half along the red car.  No probs, I will make the whole car red.  Yeh right.  Why then Elon do we not see colour at night.  If I walk outside and see my red car in darkness, my brain doesn‚Äôt say, paint it red.  Why not?  I know it‚Äôs my car.  I know my car is red.  Tell me Elon?  You don‚Äôt even know year 5 basic biology.  "
flickwtchr,"Ah, the libertarian multi-billionaire who just loves big government shoving him taxpayer money through subsidies at the consumer level, research and development level, government contracts, and of course big government shoving money via FED policy into the stock market. Oh yeah, a ""free market"" libertarian."
Happy Gilmore,I have never known anyone to interview Elon to have him think deeply to answer his questions. Such insightful questions from another bright mind.
Maroussa Metoxaraki,SO LOVELY!!!!!!
Reubs,U both looks great together 
Dion Wall,"TESLA I  SPACE WITHOUT ANY RADIATION PROTECTION, PAINT WOULD BE ON FIRE"

I listen to this interview during the day to learn, and then I listen when I go to bed to drift off to a peaceful soothing sleep."
Maggie Mae,"It's bananas, b a n a n a s, and I love bananas, b a n a n a s "
Sergei Zdorenko,Lex is the best prepared among all interviewers. Such deep and thoughtful questions!
Tos Ka,"""I got Elon to quote Shakespeare"" Lex is feeling romantic with Shakespeare. Enjoyed the bromance!  "
NeutronStream,Watched several Elon interviews over the years and this is by far the best I've seen.
Koen Mel,Its great how Elon takes his time to anwser questions
Nik sans,I love the questions lex asks lol. Always the opposite of what Elon would want to answer
Nathaniel Sanchez,"What if theory!! 

What if once people arrive to Mars (willing participants) they‚Äôre take control of like slaves or animals by the people already based up there! (Basically taken advantage of) Then the whole time people are told back on earth that it‚Äôs better than life on earth! Ouuuuwe I sure hope it doesn‚Äôt become that"
Skyler Sopp,"I admire and appreciate Elon and his unique/brilliant ideas. Reading the encyclopedia though, not sure that is one of his best ideas "
Maggie Mae,"Please use your reusable rocket on me, it's a hard problem yes, solved reuse please"
Marc San Pedro,"Lex - Fantastic interview.  I Would love to know Elon's thoughts on the competitive landscape in bleeding-edge manufacturing, specifically the additive manufacturing centric Space start-ups like Relativity Space and it's viability, and if SpaceX embraces additive manufacturing in general, the pros/cons, what types of components are produced, etc.  I am actually surprised i've never seen this asked - I find the technology Relativity builds (massive, highly specialized metal printers) highly interesting and it seems similar to the first principles type problem solving we see in Elon Musk solutions. On that note, might be interesting to explore interviewing Tim Ellis, CEO of Relativity Space.  (full disclaimer i have no connection to Relativity Space in any way.  My main interest is in how 3D printing is changing engineering)."
Fernando Sanchez,It‚Äôs so incredible to witness a CEO who knows and understand software and hardware technologies!!
Axel M T,thank you Sir. You guys are helping shape the new world
myke Does,7:02 Technically not Fundamentally
Christian Goldsbrough,"Great interview Lex, I enjoyed how your questions challenged Elon to pause for thought, and may have even changed his own thinking at one point. 
Can I ask what is the futuristic piece of equipment to your left on the show is "
jeremy T,I just don't see what's so encouraging about space x.
Patrick Dempsey,"Thanks for this Lex, great end of the year interview. I really enjoyed it."
Linda Pelle,Love Elon‚Äôs laugh 
Karl,"I wonder if Elon doing interviews like this is a massive recruiting advantage for Tesla. His description of the nitty gritty details of the technology underlying FSD must have sounded like programming porn (in a good way) to AI programmers. And if the leader of the company is ""into"" the process and product like this, it seems like it would be an awesome environment for a super-talented person to work in. Great interview."
severin wolf,AI vs 
Janie Miller,"Elon Musk is so adorable singing & being humorous... lol 
I admire Elon Musk/ he truly cares for humanity & is future forward thinking. Most important human alive that‚Äôs making the most profound impact on earth ."
John Gordon,You also have to deal with stupidity as well as wilfulness
Margot Tomasik,"I am so inspired at 59, that if I was younger I would study engineering and science to join his company. Young people need to listen to this. Elon is not only smart but very inspirational"
Jack Bohm,Such a wonderful interview.
Ubaldo 23,"Just wow, I've listened to dozens of interviews with Elon and he never ceases to amaze me. He can be funny, insightful, esoteric, and candid all at the same time. It's a privilege to live in a time where we have people like him to gather insight from. 
Oh, and he is funny as hell, he could definitely make a killing on a comedy special!"
Clifton Ellis,What a great interview!

David Alvarez,Tourism pared with manufacturing
jake dye,"So happy to see Elon back on. I took a vacation from Indianapolis to cocoa beach at cape Canaveral to watch the launch in November but it got delayed so we tried to stay, going to a cheaper air bnb, then a delay, we stayed at quadplex, we stay a night at a motel, delay, so we finally stayed 3 nights at the Jetty Campground right on the waters edge. Sadly two weeks had passed and we had to leave immediately bc we were on borrowed dime and the launch was scheduled for the next day late in the evening. It launched, sad sure, but what I didnt mention was I had the time of my life out there in every other moment other than when checking Kennedy space center website. Hope to see one in person soon, wanted to share a story inspired by the desire to see the beautiful crafts he has made possible. Thank you Elon"

Amazing interview"
Chris 432T,"Everything from rockets to cheeseburgers to dick pics.
Enjoyed this even more than the JR interviews.
Thank you LF! Super cool!"
Ted Fulcrum,"I beg you Lex, when you get Elon over again on your podcast, ask him about Bob Lazar. Other than that, solid 9/10 interview."
Uldis Barbans,"Great episode.

Too bad Elon misunderstood the question about innovation in rocket propulsion at 38:00. I hoped he would drop some insights about nuclear or something (I guess he still had cost per ton problem in his head and kept talking about that)"
D A,Just because he waits for Elon to think in silence so he can answer properly deserves a prize. Great interview
D - WOLF,"""fU#$ that we are gonna get it done"" ..wow"
Patrick McCormick,"Fantastic! We need more people to study how both of these guys approach a problem and systematically dissect it, finding solutions until they run out of segments. It should give us all hope that any of us have such magnificent abilities."

Om,"Elon should be a regular guest,
Easyly the best Duo , full with insight"
Charles Mwangi,Elon Musk's thought process pauses got me looking at my WiFi Connection. Thought YouTube was buffering Love this guy!
Discovering Diamonds,Don't question lex or he will block you.
SN00PY,As brilliant as these guys are they make for a perfect example for why we cannot allow ourselves to be ruled by intellectuals.
Dion Wall,"SUPER WEALTHY PERSONALLY, BUT CHARGED 1.6BIL IN AUSTRALIA TO BE ABLE TO LAUNCH??"
Stephen Greene,"This conversation brings great hope. 
May I express my heartfelt gratitude to Lex and to Elon both. They have hinted at our next stage of evolution into homo deus: many systems currently operate sub-optimally, our choice is between stealing the last of the pie and baking more to share."
louis p constant,Are we all just going to ignore how playful and awesome Elon is at the start? :)
JV's youtube,"fun to see Elon having abit of fun, not taking everything so super serious i say, very interesting intervjue"
John Glenn,"King Boss Musk

Georg,Brilliant...there is hope for mankind! My 6 months old grandchild's generation will be privileged...but only if people like these two dominate it.
Jay London,"Did you actually listen to it? They didn‚Äôt talk about anything. The whole video is ASMR.. 

If you focus on what they are saying they are not actually talking about anything or any particular subject. "
doc vranici,So entertaining. Just discovered this podcast. I was a big Charlie Rose fan and was very disappointed when we lost his show. This is first time I‚Äôve had the intellectual void filled by a great interview show. Thank you Lex!
Skyler Sopp,"Wow - Everyday Astronaut got quite the shoutout! I couldn‚Äôt agree more, he‚Äôs got the best rocket channel on YouTube by far"
JustJoseph,I‚Äôm so pumped. Someone that is smart enough to interview Elon
ragemachine420,When Elon takes those long pauses to think about/answer certain questions I honestly thought I was buffering  then I thought he was a robot then I thought he was angry with question and was gonna storm off set lol
Peter Fang,This video will one day be viewed by citizens of Mars and they will be bewildered by how visionary Elon was. The Father of Mars civilization.
Ziad Abosamra,"What is the meaning of ""Zero sum mindset""?"

Chuckles McGee,"I love to see Elon nerding out on things like WWII history, great questions Lex!"
La Musica,"‚ÄúElon Musk and his Tesla executives need to consider human rights in Xinjiang or risk being complicit.‚Äù

The tech billionaires have a lot of power, we need to see them making a stand"
Robert Mearns,"I wish you would ask Elon about the secret space program? He must have a classified clearance to be working with NASA. Items of interest: jump room/teleportation technology, unity/toroidal energy, the physics we never hear about, and finally, his thoughts on  Len Kasten & Andrew Basiago.  I feel the same way about accepting cookies."
AXX Is,Don't know Elon but it's disturbing the way people kowtow and idolize him. In I would have no respect for them if I in were him
Bert Lewis,"It must be very satisfying to propose an application for the products of Mr Musk's(I don't feel like I can call him Elon) engineering that he himself has not considered. Lex,(I'm a subscriber so I do feel I can call you by your first name) you may have just changed all our future!"
Mind's Eye View,Mind controlled saber tooth
Mark Lucas,Fantastic! This conversation between these two people at this time in history is just wonderful!
chevyvettz06,"I feel that it's such a privilege to be alive in the same span of time as Elon Musk. I believe that much like Leonidas, people will still be talking about his legacy thousands of years from now."
Kevin Michael Callihan Sr,"What an interesting fellow of the craft with so much knowledge while inspiring all with his virtues of truth and integrity, is indeed inspiring to watch and hear. I like the delays, at times, in thought processes, in order to answer things in a deliberate way. That works, and you can see it working. Thank you kindly, Lex Fridman for a good interview."
Amin Ababneh,@Lex Fridman please get John Carmack on the broad cast and have him prepare something on the though of fast processing for something like a Tesla car... He is the man!
Matthew Sharp,I am convinced now that Elon Musk will go down as the 21st Century's most influential figure. Who else in this century so far could claim to make such an impact on the direction of the human race?
David Alvarez,Do we understand space?
Mathew Hegan,"""So you're saying there's a chance."" Love the Dumb and Dumber reference Lex!"
Michael Inzinna,#tesla
Person of Interest,I'm going to love this. Elon has small children - I believe he is making the world a better place for them. And therefore my grandchildren. Thank you Lex for your high-quality Interviews. Love from the granny in South Africa üáøüá¶
Neura Pod - Neuralink,Great questions Lex. Thank you
Gera Castro,I would like to hear Elon to explain why he is not down with smart contracts he totally dodged the question.
Serban Nicolau,Somebody is way too happy.
Alexander McCarthy,Direct Democracy!! I'm so glad Elon said that. I'm Swiss and we do have the best political system.
quellenathanar,This is what people who are afraid of dislike technology don't get. Grow the pie. There's enough for everyone to eat. Do away with poverty by making the bottom floor a comfortable existence.
Mr. L,This is the most comfortable i‚Äôve seen Elon talking with another person lol.  I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre legit friends.
D-railed,"As a an aerospace tool and die maker, it's very easy to become jaded and frustrated with engineers in the feild. so many times they try to make all the faults of their designs fall on the shop floor for whatever reason and it's like pulling teeth sometimes to get them to admit their design is flawed in someway and rework it. Elon seems like he would be a pleasure to work with and really listens to input from the people who manufacture and assemble the products they are creating.  It's such an iterative process, even the guy de burring the parts can give you valuable insight how to improve.  I enjoy my work the most getting sincerely asked for input rather then being treated like another piece of shop equipment... do that and I will just make whatever you put on the print to a tee, even if I see obvious problems with it."
A A,Elon‚Äôs silence before replying questions is like as he is mentat from the Dune universe.
Brian Brett,Act quickly. While the window is open. Just in case. It closes.
Loop,"I wish somebody would ask him how far into the future he thinks it'll be before we have spacecraft that are meant to stay in space and are not constrained by aerodynamics and conventional mass and density limitations current spacecraft are limited to.  However, as always, amazing content from Lex Fridman."
Lou Belle,Pave the way to hell with cookies......a tasty way to get people to go down the rabbit hole.
Hugo E Wada,I watched A LOT of Elon Musk and you are probably the most suitable interviewer for him. Much love :D
Martin Huyton,"Elon, as much as I love you, it's impossible to bring things from Earth to Mars. We can take them because our journey would originate on Earth. If we were on Mars and we could do something from there to cause objects on Earth to travel to Mars, then we would be able to bring things to Mars. Grammar!"
Nick G,"Lex, I just finished watching and I feel the need to congratulate you on what is, in my opinion, the best Elon Musk interview to date. Thank you for not asking the same 10 basic questions Elon is asked in every interview. The only question I would love Elon to answer that you didn't quite cover are his thoughts on the possibility of his technology, although conceived with humanity's best interest in mind, being used for nefarious purposes and what steps he is taking if any to prevent the technologies his companies are pioneering from being used in such a way to enslave or harm humanity."
frying2012,"Always wondering how.. and why.. Elon is making free so much time for doing these loooooong interviews. I really don't know any person in his position that does this kind of thing so often. And if, then it's typically on a large network tv channel. Btw. Elon is wearing the same shirt as with the ""FULL INTERVIEW: Elon Musk Sits Down With The Babylon Bee"" interview, released a few days before this one."
William Cox,Thank God for YouTube! If it weren't for such place I believe that the world would not be as smart as it is. I mean if I need to rebuild my engine in my car I can. It may not be fast but I could do it.To provide this access to true geniuses is priceless. I can only hope that the rest of world gets to see this man's ideals and follow suit.
Hiki Stewart,"Everything was normal until the nonsense about communism and Stalin began. The presenter began to read Solzhenitsyn, you can't find a bigger pizdobol.
Later, they began to praise Soviet science, which was actually created under the leadership of Stalin, like almost everything else Soviet. The presenter became disgusting to me when he was carried away by a lie."
Chris Hopf,Would be interesting to hear his thoughts on (a) why a civilization on Mars would play out diff than the USA has since 1500's to now ... (b) why a democracy is not subject to same and/or diff special interests influence that caused him to favor it over a republic .... (c) how much more time a civilization on Mars has if the expanding sun makes earth unlivable [ref: 32:42 mark]? 
David Alvarez,Like cells in a body
Jack Harle,I like that Elon actually thinks about the answers to questions. I believe he's incapable of telling something he doesn't think is true.
Mike Mancuso,"I was really hoping to learn something new‚Ä¶ I could‚Äôve given these answers last year. Hard to build a robot? Ever hear of a 3d printer? 5-10 years? China‚Äôs prob there now building the first all you can eat buffets. Last question, will 1 BTC be enough to get my wife to Mars."
Cliff Kung,"you did ask great bunch of questions, thank you."
Laurence,great interview but LEX is pailful to listen to.

Regina Schmidt,"First full interview with Elon Musk I have watched and this definitely changed my view of him to a much more positive one. Awesome talk, Lex! I mean everyone is presenting themselves in interviews to look good, but I feel like there may actually be a big impactful depth with this man that I didn't really believe in before this interview. I also didn't know that Elon Musk supports direct democracy! Thumbs up! I live in Germany and literally the only time I felt like I had any fair political democratic agency for my life and environment was when the city of Hamburg allowed its citizens to vote whether or not they want to get a cable car in their harbor. I might be happy because the outcome was supporting my view, but even before I knew the outcome this was an impactful experience that really for once didn't leave me feel political resignation, but made me feel quite alive. Also the topic of the cleansing functions of wars on rules and regulations makes sense. Hopefully we can maintain peace and make the world live in peace fully in the future, but rules and regulations are starting to get really dysfunctional and there should be a better process."
Zamix,I really admire Elon
Christian Fulton,"Amazing interview Lex. Thank you for putting the time into your questions that allowed Elon to explore and not just explain. This interview captured something that many people miss. Elon had a beautiful mind not just from a purely intellectual level, but a mind that cares deeply about humanity as a whole and of the human condition."
G F,"I think elon on the part of smart contracts, when he says keep contracts simple and in plain language, he's missing a problem, we are humans, we make mistakes and have loads of flaws, we'll never do things easy"
Sue Annah,"Lex, I enjoyed the podcast video you posted online with Elon Musk.  I would like to ask you questions but since social media has been infested with posers, it's been difficult for me to trust it.  Anyway I can contact you directly please?"
Nonya,There won't be humans on Mars because there was never meant to be. God always wins.
Todd Lee,"In the far future, I wonder how World Governments would eventually react to their populations leaving to colonize Mars & create their own colonial Governments‚Ä¶(ie 1620-1700‚Äôs colonization of America / 13 colonies of America vs. British rule, taxes, etc.)  Will authorizations by Governments be needed prior? So many questions "
buzzcrushtrendkill,"Crypto (BTC) was made to be a currency.  But it isn't.  Your not going to use it to buy dinner. You have to turn it back into fiat to use as a payment system.  It's a speculative investment.  It only increases in value if more people buy it after you did.  It's not a digital asset, storage of value nor hedge against inflation. It has no utility.  It's a digital tulip.  All the crypto coins will disappear in value as it becomes more apparent to the general population. Crypto will be adopted by banks and a national crypto currency will be adopted.  That will be the future of crypto."
scouttis,"Hi Lex, Thank you for this amazing podcast! I'm amazed by your calm composure, intelligence and the excellent way you handle these conversations! Cheers from Finland!"
Lincoln,Elon has heard about technology that bends Space. That is the answer to intergalactic travel
Sam-Nicolai Johnston,"I feel like he's underestimating the complexity of solving real-world problems for a humanoid. It seems much more complex than for a car.

It seems much more complex on both the movement in & interaction with the world (i.e. the  under-actuated dynamics of the robot & it's grasp on objects) and also on the decision making process. i.e. going from A to B on 2d roads for which we have high quality GPS maps is not the same as the hundreds of thousands of things that a humanoid needs to do to accomplish a task."
Bert Battersby,"We do not need cookies, because cookies are an intuitive mechanism to look at what or where you have been on or in the WWW web."
2002RM,"The problem with some of these ""Engineering"" type responses is that the solutions are superficial when humans operate in such a more dynamic way. For example, the discussion on money or currency in Mars. I completely get Musk's pragmatic reasoning about being unable to synchronise currency due to light speed delay etc etc. I don't think he understands why the discussion of having a currency in the first place is a fundamental question to a civilisation in Mars."
Daniel Persson,"1.50-2.00,the only way that happendes is if we get to a point where people live their lives without greed"

Matt,Totally agree on laws being simple and easy and the idea of them fading out on own os genius! Idk about mars though I think the have better chance of throwing bacteria and minerals at it and see what sticks and evolves. That seems more likely to me than humans skipping steps to try and survive at this point in time at least. But.. both have the same effect I suppose even if the humans and large animals don‚Äôt survive something might. I‚Äôm still curious about water there

It auto applying the brakes almost causing a rear end collision by a concrete truck....

David Alvarez,Brings up inflation
Vegas Cycling Freak,"1:14:30 My problem with self driving cars is that they don't have human intuition. As a human you can get a feeling, like someone is not going to stop at a stop sign or a red light, and indeed they don't. You correctly made a prediction, were prepared for it and didn't get into an ""accident"". Or, as happens quite often here in Las Vegas,  when you see a car weaving around and going too fast your intuition may tell you that that person is driving while drunk. You might quickly turn onto a side street to avoid being killed by them. What happens when a drunk is driving on the wrong side of the freeway at 2 AM and coming straight at you? Human intuition has literally saved my life a few times. What is a self driving car going to do to predict such things? A machine can only respond/react to what its sensors are telling it."

Ashley Meyer,"One question for Elon I didn't here you discuss was, ""what is his motivation for or drive to extend the life of humanity, i.e. continue to explore space travel and establishing a self sufficient civilization there?"" He mentions to not do this, ""It would be a tragedy"",  but why? Why is there a need to move beyond our world and the enumourous things we could focus on here? If the earth has 10% of its life left due to the sun, then that amount of time is longer than we can conceive in terms of the existence of humans at all. Why the need to solve the potential survivability of humans 1.5 million years from now?  Interesting he focuses on this futuristic problem?"

Topher Dean,"I'm surprised Fridman didn't have something to say about Musk's assertion that England and America had the best fuel, so better engines could be made and that was a pivotal role in winning the war.  Well, a lot of people point to a lot of pivotal roles in winning the war, but not many people ever mention the greatest factor in winning, anything; passion.  America likes to say ""they"" won the war.  You hardly ever hear anyone in America say, Russia won the war, but Russia won the war and the reason they were the decisive factor in winning that war was their passion, not better technology.  They were like, no fcking way you are taking over our country, that is not going to happen.  The end result is they sacrificed nearly every adult male in the country.  Women took over everything in society while the men fought to the death.  The Germans only had this idealistic desire for control and greed, it's not enough to generate the kind of passion it takes to win.  Russia's entire identity, culture, way of life were on the line and they fought with everything they had, down to the bitter end, to the death.  That's what wins.  That's why after 20 years of war, the world's largest war machine failed to overthrow the Taliban.  That's their country, their way of life, they just care more about it than America does, so they picked up our rubbish and unexploded ordinances and beat us with it until we gave up.  It's also funny that Musk views war as tiny blips in time.  America has been at war for it's entire history, except for just a handful of years.  That only a small percentage of people participate in this activity is another matter."
ThElement,"Elon when you said you don‚Äôt need a source of strength after that long silence that you obviously answered in a deeply personal truth, a tear welled in my eye. I would like to propose a new superhero in your honor named, Atlas Alpha Centauric. Your super powers are powers you hone every day. I hope you find the name fitting and inspiring and with the super powers a high compliment from a deep respect and appreciation for your participation in mankind. On another note, I have developed a theory of self existence that is simple to grasp and practice, gaining exponential development, refinement, and understanding while greatly reducing the rate at which time passes and  a ever deepening inner peace. I believe you would find great benefit for all aspects of your life and thoroughly enjoy. Please let me know when your interest has peaked and i can send you a two page introduction to understanding paper i recently was able to put on to paper and the rest will fall into place. This would be a gift from a brother as your money has no value within this. Thank you both for sharing your lives and knowledge with us. PS Lex the deal is good for you too brother."

Sebastian K√∂bele,"Thought about Self-driving:
Doesn‚Äôt that mean you need to train your neural net for every country/civilisation/cultur? Because i feel like the traffic evolved different in different cultures. Even going from cities to the country side must make a huge different in anticipating what will happen to moving people/things next to the road. Especially if you go to more rural areas where there are more different kind of traffic particpants. Walking people, animals, cyclists, Trucks, extra wide mobile machines, ect."

Norien McNorien,"of course tech is important but what is the equation?  Feed dying children and help needed social programs the world over vs. the MANY benefits of pushing upward and outward with and toward greater tech.
I am NOT judging!  I do not know the answer.  I do know we need both, and so many other things.  BUt these two weigh heavily on my heart as I think of the last minutes of Schindler's list and his despair at what more he could have done.  Again, I KNOW both need funding and I have NO idea how to balance or justify the equation that is needed.  The present one I believe vehemently must be changed.  When a girl can sing on a commercial and make you tear up over animals dying but no one is making a hard push in the same way as the SPCA regarding the children of our country.  Their education and many many needs.  Billions of dollars from the continued making of nuclear weapon stockpiles still being built so we can destroy the world a million times over.  As Truman? warned of the military corporate machine we see it now in action.  I know I'm wandering now.  I have no answers.  Just worries and questions.  Maybe greater minds will read this and have an epiphany would happen in some happy SciFi film and a Cinderella ending would follow lol."

Jack Arroway,"Elon suggesting 'direct democracy' is funny...  (two quick reasons).  1)Who'd own the Mars mission if it ever did happen, who paid for it and made it happen, or knows what's best for the mission? (with a non-expert population, no democratic vote is justified).  And, 2)Will you have only highly educated, intelligent, and cooperative 'citizens'... since if you had morons in space, they could 'vote' like idiots, the way they do in America (average IQ in USA is under 100).  Or will everyone on Mars have a brain chip for control?"

Ashley Meyer,"Similar question as previous. I agree Elon is ingenious and creative in his ideas i.e. self driving vehicles. But why does he want self driving cars vs. Say me driving myself. If the human brain is so challenging to immunity particularly w self driving vehicles, why do it. What is his obsession or passion with AI or computer driven world? What is wrong with humans doing these things?  Why not put his energy into solving problems like clean water shortage, etc. Would his time not be better spent in other areas or equally admirable scientific and engineering feats?"
