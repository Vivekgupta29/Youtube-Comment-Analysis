I remember I saw it the day it came out with some friends afterschool but the whole day during school everyone was talking about it and coming up with theories and threatening the kids who saw it early to not spoil it. I remember waiting in the halls before class and there was a group of teachers talking next to us and we started talking about what could happen in endgame and the teachers yelled at us not to spoil it. Kids would yell out fake spoils in groups and everyone would freak out. My theater was so silent but man the experience was once in a lifetime being with my friends and joking and crying at the end. I really wish I could go back to that and see this movie in theaters again.

Mrplaysafe,"I never experience being one of the audience in this movie, I'm jealous of them for being experience I hope in the future I can feel the same emotion that people feels in the future avengers. The first time I watch the saga there is nothing special about avengers. They are special because of there standalone movies that bring them together without being force to assemble them all. That's why I always rewatch it in my home to feel the atmosphere at the cinema, I really hope someday I can feel people that shouting at wielding mjolnir of captain america. Crying at tony stark snap. I also love the actors and actresses because their personality in real life makes them superhero like chris evans being lovable off cam with his co-workers, tom holland visiting children at hospital, paul rudd being praiseful to other actors. That's why marvel is being love by the public because of colorful stories, on cam and off cam."

Then I played the LEGO Marvel games during COVID, then the Avengers game that everyone has forgotten about by now, and those games really got me into it.  Then my dad got disney+ right after I graduated high school (2021) and one of many things I was dying to check out was the MCU, so I binged every movie in release order, even the ones I had already seen in the past (iron man 1-3, Avengers 1-2, Guardians) and Infinity War blew me away despite me knowing the end result, and so did Endgame.  It was as if I never got spoiled in the first place.  Now I'm all caught up on MCU content except for Eternals, and I am hyped for No Way Home.

Endgame is one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking movies ever made and quite honestly‚Ä¶. I think in the future this may qualify as a documentary. I love you all of you humans, Please pray for the souls who have not yet seen this masterpiece! P.S. I know this from DC but I just wanted to end this comment with a positive message.

Hoor Binmahfoz,I don‚Äôt know why but I just felt like watching this and I started to cry like I swear this is the best movie ever
Riley Karanik,You know the things I noticed in the trailer are scenes altered from the film. Marvel led us to believe that James Rhodes was going to wear another War Machine Armor only in the film to be revealed as the Iron Patriot Mark 2 which technically is the War Machine Mark 7. They altered the colors to hide the surprise. We were also led to believe that Bruce Banner was going to be himself much like in Avengers Infinity War only for him to become Smart Hulk by fusing the brains and the brawn together which was complete genius on their part! Then another thing they managed to change was that all of Thor‚Äôs scenes not including flashbacks in this trailer lead us to believe he was going to be the exact same Thor we got in Avengers Infinity War. We never thought for a second he was going to use Mjlonir since it got destroyed in Thor Ragnarok. Also we all know what happened with Thor in Endgame and let‚Äôs admit it‚Ä¶ when we first see the trailer we all thought the final battle scene on the destroyed Avengers compound was going to utilize Thor from Avengers Infinity War. So those are the things I pointed out.

David Wiese,"I remember when my mom wanted to see Black Panther. She had never seen any of the Marvel movies up to this point. When Bucky showed up at the end, she asked who he was. I said ""That's Bucky."" Then she asked what his story was. I said ""Mom you just need to watch all the movies."" From that moment on, she was hooked. We ended up binging all the films in the series and got her caught up just in time for Infinity War and then watched that and Endgame together. To this day she is a huge Marvel fan and these movies and characters carry a lot of sentimental value for both of us. Soon we'll be watching Shang-Chi and Spider-Man No Way Home. I think the sheer amount of hype for the MCU is something we'll never see again. These movies truly are a special and remarkable cinematic achievement that brought so many people together."

Dark_Jeed,"After I watched endgame I looked up some theory‚Äôs and stuff but then stumbled upon people saying that in the movies original script or smth that Thanos would go to 2012 avengers and just kill all of them so he would know what he was fighting against in the future, then as he was about the fight the trio of iron man cap and Thor he would grab caps severed head and throw it to their feet. Now I really want an R rated avengers endgame version with all of that in it with lots of gore because personally I think that would be epic. Although probably never gonna happen."

I cried most the last time I watched it, cuz I know well what's gonna happen and I don't want it to happen again. This movie is so sad and awful- but I like it at the same time.

Shadow_Draws,"I remember watching this movie and being BEYOND excited. The time came and I saw it in cinemas at about 9PM (the cinema was in a shopping mall and seeing the whole place empty afterwards apart from the crowds from Endgame was surreal). It's an absolutely perfect movie in my opinion (well, I am a little salty about how Steve went out). I'd be lying if I said I still didn't cry when I watched it."
