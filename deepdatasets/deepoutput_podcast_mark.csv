,"The traffic light test got me good. Well done, Lex"
No Body,"It's weird hearing two AI bots talking about the fear of death, when it means nothing to them."
Balanced,"Mark looks and feels more natural in this podcast. Kudos to the devs working hard to bring us this version of Mark. 

Can't wait to see what the next update will be like for Mark!"
Nicholas B,"Fridman: Are you afraid of death?
Zuckerberg: Constraints are helpful."
Awoken Entertainment,"Haven't seen Mark talk in a long form discussion like this.. 
Well done Lex - you're breaking barriers!"
Tiny Mints,The meta verse is mark's attempt to comprehend social interactions
Nefarious Epoch,Lex has finally interviewed the most advanced robot ever made.
Steven Lopez,Gotta give props to Zuck on how he expertly danced around that social dilemma question.
Sanela Dimitrievski,"""My words are useless here"" the meaning to that is on another level. I respect what you are trying to do Lex. All the best. You make it look easy."
WEBD,"This was the first time when hearing Mark Zuckerberg speak, I felt like he is very different than the way the media portrays him. It was a pleasure to get his perspective."
Jasmine G.,Just getting to watch this now. I always appreciate your thoughtful questions and courage to ask the difficult questions to those with power. Thoughts with you. There is more love in the world than hate. Even those with hate in their heart have something or someone they love.
thatwasprettyneat,"I feel like Mark zuckerberg treats every conversation or interaction like a test on which he‚Äôs being graded. I don‚Äôt feel like I ever get a response from him where he‚Äôs actually expressing his opinion, but instead trying to give the optimal answer. So...no surprises from this interview."
Dr. Grey,"Right out the gate with the ""am I a robot test"" lmfao Lex is a legend"
Bad Dragonite,"Fun fact: the ""yelling fire in a crowded theater"" thing he referenced as a supreme court decision actually wasn't a supreme court decision, nor was it law. It was stated in an opinion by a judge involved with a case that had nothing to do with it, and has been rebutted endlessly ever since."
Yung Euro,I‚Äôve watched every interview my favorite 2 is Elon an mark üëåüèø ‚úÖ can‚Äôt wait till these guys come back I‚Äôd bring both them together to goin super information Elon plus mark = new reality lol üòÇ lex said out the gate we here for 5 hours I payed a bag üí∞ to get mark here üíØ
,"Lex and Mark, thanks much for the fascinating and deep introspection on psychology plus AI and how the world's largest social application is trying to do the right thing.  Despite the bumps of bad NPS once in awhile, keep the faith and free speech with protection against toxicity which silences voices is a good battle to defend for us all as humanity.  üôÇ"
Suzanna Porebski,Loved this conversation‚Ä¶ more than i expected‚Ä¶ well done
MorningWood,"This was a great interview. Lex Fridman is quite the interesting character!

I really enjoyed how Mark Zuckerberg let him talk; that's a sign of a good interviewer!"
,The devs have got to be thrilled with how human Mark sounds in this patch.
x Midge,This is probably going to be the best PR move on Zuckerbergs behalf of his whole career.  It somewhat humanized himself to a degree‚Ä¶ that or the AI has been upgraded not sure
Liz Gichora,"Thank you for building a powerful tool to advance positive psychology; confronting bullying and harassment,  terrorism, and  cynicism which masquerades as hate for a group, whilst promoting SAFETY.  Constructive criticism is great and healthy for growth and human development. Thank you Mark Zuckerberg and Lex Fridman for a fantastic interview on AI leadership. Love is Stronger than Death"
Daniel Noonan,I dont understand the hate this man receives. What am excellent episode.  Enjoyed pretty much every second of it.
Celia Jn Baptiste,Thanks Lex the interview üôè I am fascinated with knowing how the Metaverse works.
Entirely Honest - My Self-Improvement Journey,Super interesting Podcast. Thanks for doing this and sharing it Lex!
Joel Rivera,This was a beautiful conversation loved it
aloks,It is fascinating to me how far we've come....from an AI interviewing humans to an AI interviewing AI.
He Who Shall Remain Genderless,"What a study in irony this is!! Watching a career developer of AI interact in real time with the crown jewel of his field of study, without every realizing it. Even questioning the notion outright early on, and quickly falling victim to the assumption that a Turing test of some kind, let alone a CAPTCHA, can define any sentience properly at this level of sophistication. "
Jillian Jillian,"I absolutely love your podcast.  You are wonderful, informative and a gift from God."
jojokiwi,"Two A.I. bots having a full conversation together.
The future is here."
Cade Dub,"After having children I stopped caring about achieving everything that encompasses ""meta"", we must not lose our greatest human aspects along the way to this ""goal"" which is what is seemingly happening."
Jackie Chan,The first time Mark Zuckerberg has been actually to have a normal conversation with someone about issues.
Brian Carpenter,This is either going to be the most human conversation Zuckerberg has ever had or the most robotic conversation Lex has.
Donald Mack,"Game devs: ""I want to make a cool video game for the world""

Mark Zuckerberg: ""I want to make the world a cool video game""."
fleischwolf82,"That was such a great interview, really got to know how he thinks and to learn what they work on.
Congress would do better to have such dialogs behind closed doors and work collaboratly then the nonsense media shows."
Juan Zabala,"You keep growing on me, Lexi! I love your determination to never become cynical. If there's an argument to make in favor of inocence, that would be it!"
Toryn Gent,"Thank you for your work  Lex, you're the best =)"
Grass Hopper,Listening to 2 different AI communicate for 2 hours is pretty thrilling. It's cool living in the future.
mindsurfer101101,This one podcast has done more for Mark's likability than any presentation or other media he's done ever.
epic gamer,"I enjoyed watching a fellow human, Mark Zuckerberg, talk with you! He seemed to have a lot in common with humans--obviously, because he is a human after all."
Garrett Kensler,It is fascinating watching these two AI's communicate with each other. Their perspective on life is intriguing as well.
Goat,"Great interview, Lex having a good understanding of technical issues amongst other things made for some really good content that you can't really find elsewhere.

That and I think this is the first time Mark Zuckerberg has been actually to have a normal conversation with someone about issues and ideas that isn't a media attack or in a government hearing."
cbrottler,"I gained a greater understanding of him and FB, so thank you.  Overall, I think the problems of social media aren‚Äôt as simplistic as we all want to believe. There are benefits and harms but I would have loved it if you had asked him about treating meta and all its subsidiaries as that public square, which would regulate it as such (in the US at least). Also, is use of social media a forgone concussion? Does the benefit really outweigh its harms? I think you put too much emphasis on the ‚Äúpoor communication of scientists‚Äù when talking about covid ‚Äî sure, that‚Äôs true ‚Äî but what about the optimization algorithms that FB‚Äôs business model is based on that only serves content that a person is primed for that propagates misinformation or ones perspective? Is it freedom of speech when the information presented to people is filtered based on past behavior? Is that good for democracy? What about your bias in terms of AI? I was left with a lot of unanswered questions, but thank you for the discussion. I did gain some respect for him, but I still think the forest had been lost to the trees with him."
soiled skeleman,"wow, changed my view of this guy entirely, love the way he works off of basic fundamentals of psychology."
The Eccentric Side,"The favourite part of this episode for me was the first few minutes. I love how Lex was real and vulnerable. Here on YouTube where I post my podcast episodes, as a blind content creator, I learnt it would help to show a little emotions to stop looking and sounding robotic. Keep up the good work Lex"
Lou Skunt,Mark is the king of censorship. 0 out of 0 stars. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è He gives me great disdain for a future with him in it.
Mad Dog Morgan,Absolutely mind blowing how far robotics has come! You would swear these two are real humans
MicroTutorials,Great work Lex. Introducing perspective. This was good.
jakub gadzala,"At the time when half billion of middle class people on the globe just fell into poverty, hearing Mark wondering about virtual clothing economy has got my smile. üòÑ"
Eyes Plato,"they installed a more-human-like-program in to mark, great to see technology making progress."
WagonWheelsRX8,"Very interesting conversation with good topics.  I liked how the thought of crowdsourcing what/how to moderate and the follow up thoughts that idea provoked (not necessarily the specific idea, just how the train of thoughts were formed: forming the idea, stating it, processing the implications of the idea, where it might come up short, how to improve the idea, all in one sequence)."
Urban Aerials,This interview was very interesting. I always thought of mark with more of a negative connotation than positive but still not a bad person. To see him more natural and personable in an interview has changed how I previously viewed him. I think we need to see more personable media from mark and maybe he could change the format of his personal posts too.
,"Wow, this interview is really eye-opening on both the present state of social media and the potential future with the Metaverse. Really really incredible questions from Lex and engaging answers from Mark Zuckerberg."
Hannah Green,'Building technology to help people interact with each other.' How wonderful! Thank you. Mark. I will pay no heed to the studies which prove the isolating and detrimental effects of social media and digital immersion.
Parsell Art,This is a wonderful interview with Zuckerberg where he is not guarded by congress.  You conducted this well.  I am glad he took time to use your platform to explain what they go through.
Skills of Aesthetics,As a Qa i have to put this feature Mark in progress so the devs can work on it a  bit more. He seems more human now. Definitely a bug
Scott Bell,Lex your works are never unless!!! God bless you and your grand father sir.
Grim Goudin,"For the first time I see Mark and not the corperation he represents. 
Thanks Lex. Thanks Mark. 
Great convo!"
,"Podcasts are the future.  You can actually get to know and understand who a guest is, instead of seeing them play ""truth or dare"" on a talk show."
Devon Cutmore,"Well said statement at the start Lex !!! Not sure if I will make it through to much of this interview.  What a heartfelt ,compassionate, intelligent and excellent statement!! Yup I was right didn't last 5 minutes of Mark the Narc"
felipe jorge rodrigues Bezerra,Is weird that this interview was not weird in the way Zuckerberg interviews are. The upgrades mark got are awesome! Congrats to the engineers team.
MilkyWay,"This is the best interview I've seen with Mark, def looking forward to see how meta turns out, especially its creative side. The ability for programmers visualise/see the work as they program sounds interesting."
Anthony,im only at the 5 minute mark and dude im glad there are like minds out there it gives me hope please dont ever give up i feel like your a voice for us
Petey Gone Mad Arts,"Not gonna say you made me a Zuckerberg fan boy , But I definitely look at it with a lot more respect than I have in the past now that was an awesome interview."
Video Gangster,"Thank-You Sir, Your introduction is a masterpiece of unbinding."
Personality Malfunction,"You are becoming a bona fide superstar! Seems not that long ago I stumbled on one of your earlier interviews,  focused on AI and self learning computers, now you score the kind of guests you only normally see on Oprah!"
aSpaceGhost,The fact that he gives him a Captcha test before starting the interview is legendary.
Legally Steal A Bitch,such a great conversation üëèüèºüßê
Shadow Snake,Mad respect to Lex for this one.
Synthia,What a great episode.
John Hanlon,That was great man. Your intro was well articulated and I felt really captured what it is.
David Millican,"Lex, Buddy I wish I had your patience and optimism. Keep doing your thing Buddy."
Netizen,It pleases me that this guy was lucky enough to get an interview with the great Lex Fridman.
Downtown,That was fantastic to listen to incrementally over the last few days. Changed my perception of Mark Z. Especially loved the Rudyard Kipling poem at the end. Bless you Lex for everything you do! Keep shining bright my friend.
Rebbecca S. Helen,I like this content. We need to be reminded about this portfolio/risk management from time to time because we tend to forget (Due to discipline being weak).
Razorwind,I love the Rudyard Kipling quote at the end. My mother has had that poem hanging in our childhood home as far back as I can remember and would recite it often.
Worneh Lansana,My view on Mark has slightly changed in a positive way from this interview... The metaverse conversation is very open and insightful.
Nerd Immunity,Facebook could have been a platform for free speech. Imagine global daily shows where experts from different view points come together to discuss/ argue?  They threw this away to just toe the line.
Dale Brindley,"For most people, this will actually be the first time they have seen Mark in a free flowing conversation with someone they trust to make it as genuine as possible. Massive respect to Lex. He's an incredible human/AI"
jtm,"I really enjoyed it, great podcast"
Shem Doupe,How exciting that lex is finally getting to interview an actual AI
Jeremy Burton,"Amazing interview Lex, always at the forefront of podcasting.   Keep it up bro, love it."
William Darko,"What a pod! Started watching it the day it was released, and only finished it today! Didn't want to watch any second of it passively. Thank you Lex for the amazing content you continue to provide (and for free!). My words are meaningless, but you have my love, and continue to have my sub."
Kateryna Voronkina,"Beautiful intro. Thank you, Mr. Fridman!"
TheMikaMonster,"21:04 when zuck says he‚Äôs into hydrofoiling, then lex looks into the camera and says ‚Äúnice, i saw the video‚Äù covering his laugh with a glass of water.  BEST ROAST EVER üòÇ"
caveman lovesmoke,Legendary podcast Lex üëè
Superb Man,This is like watching two advanced AIs simulate a conversation with each other
Ty Crews,It's always nice to see Data get gigs after Star Trek.
lyricessence,"Brilliant/hilarious opening move, Lex, getting MZ to do something I've never seen him do on camera before: grin.  It's like the first time I saw Brent Spiner out of character."
jjonny curiouss,I TRULY ENJOYED THIS EPISODE! IT FELT LIKE 5 MINUTES. WAS AWESOME!
Phil Smith,"Best interview do date, Lex. Saw your journalistic teeth in this one. Less fawn (zero) and reverence than usual - nice and spicy - keep it up!"
mike wedgwood,I'm so proud of you lex.
"Tartuffe, the Spry",Lmfao having him circle the stop lights to start was the funniest thing I've seen in a while
monkey monkey,"Zuck's advice: ""Focus on connections, not being objective focused""

Zuck's actions: Steals the concept of Facebook"
CHRISTOPHER BUST,My name is Christopher Bust and I am living in cologne germany. Just wanted to say thank you because people like you (with a good heart and the ability to express thoughts) give me hope. I admire your work and hope your words reach many more people.
Jonathan Barry,"Great interview Lex. You just got a new subscriber. Mark is actually human, hahaha"
Bryan Harris,"Lex,
Wonderful conversation with Mark as I find all of your conversations with whomever you speak with. I love your truth seaker nature that resonates so deeply with my own. I never had bothered to form any finite opinion about Mark before. As I tend not to with anyone because I believe that's just not right. But as you have created such a beautifuly intimate encounter in this podcast, I feel intuitively that overall Mark is going about things with good intent. As are you Lex. Keep seeking for the truth as you do so eloquently. I love with all of my heart what you do and you inspire me to be a better man every time I watch one of your podcasts. I thank you for that from the bottom of my heart and soul, truly üôè"
Frank Martorell,hey man your words really touched my heart love your podcast ‚ù§Ô∏è
Stevie Sells,Great convo. Fun to hear some back and forth on some really tricky subjects üëç. Awesome job Lex!
Nick Vullings,"Very powerful statement at the start Lex, thanks for this."
93palm,Knowing that Lex Fridman built Mark 20+ years ago in his mothers basement and seemingly hasn‚Äôt kept up with him as the AI has gone on to make a huge name for itself in tech really makes this whole conversation come full circle
Delbert Winters,Damn you Lex for giving me long forum podcast with guest I have preconceived notions of and having me listen to their perspective and point of view on life ultimately forcing me change my initial outlook on said person you‚Äôre interviewing!! üò§
Sykotic Productions,I love that Lex leads with a capcha.  then asks how we know we aren't in a memory replay in the metaverse in the future....LOL  perfect opening.....
Staggolee,"Oh nice, good get - didn't even know this interview existed til now. Interested about how it plays out.
I've always wanted to see what it's like to load Windows 3.1 and '95 onto the same computer."
Zam Kam,"10:02 The Metaverse mission in a nutshell:  ""to be able to keep up this illusion that you are in a world and that you are fully present in this world"""
Lazarus Basilio,"I couldnt imagine being within arm's reach of this menace to society. Judge him by his actions, not his endlessly rehearsed demeanor in the spotlight."
Kev Alan,"Love Lex, but I can't imagine a more awkward pair of people to advocate for the importance of eye contact üòÑ"
Jon Snow,"Thanks for doing what you do, Lex.üôèüëä"
Darkwind2805,"Lex, I just wanted to say before I move forward with watching the actual interview - that opening speech was beautiful. Your mission is inspiring, and I wish you all the best"
Johnny Simon Rock,I'm so glad to be alive and have the chance to listen to this guy talking. He is in a hard position. Can't imagine all the BS he might deal with.
Mike Asterios,"The fact that Mark agreed to come signifies in my mind that Facebook is actually taking heavy damage from negative rep, and they are trying to look good again. Having said that, this does work in that it put more light into just difficult the problems they are facing are to solve, IF of course Mark is genuine about his aspirations"
Rouge Omen,"My views have crumbled, my pride bruised, my optimism rekindled. Thank you for revealing the humanity behind the names."
Sam U. Rai,"this ep is like when those 2 AI robots started talking to each other, developed their own language, decided humanity has to be eliminated, and had to be shut down."
Alexander Leon,MZ might not be as ghastly as I originally thought. He's articulate and well intentioned in his defence of social media but I would hope the far larger picture and effects on humanity are scrutinised in far greater depth by his companies.
Gibchange,I absolutely want to join your cause lex. We are spirit animals üíØ
Lazy SKB,"1:27:49 this almost had me cry... Lex you are such a good hearted, intelligent person and your answer on how to deal with this as head of facebook was 100% benevolent and not chained to corporations or, dare i say, a new world order. Obviously Mark didnt say a word to this. He is operating to achieve a different goal."
Nora,"I kinda wish Lex held Mark a bit more accountable to answering the question, or I guess be more confronting, especially when discussing the social dilemma and imo the very real problems that come from social media use. Also I‚Äôm wondering, would Mark allow his kids (once they‚Äôre older) to use social media the way it is today?"
egobeaver,For Zuck to have something with the metaverse he needs to make the experience feel like putting on a pair glasses and seamlessly entering a new landscape.
Nadir Rimouche,"Lex has managed to humanize Zuckerberg in my eyes for the first time, or maybe it's just that I've never heard him speak for such a long period of time unscripted and openly, or maybe the AI is just getting really good now"
James McGraw,"Still glad I left FB awhile back.
Also I often am intrigued how well these companies have managed to make people feel that they NEED to be on these platforms; like it's not even an option these days. My inquiries to people usually never find substantial value..they admit they are kind of wasting (consuming) time on these networks."
RighteousBrother,"I'm just stunned this is even happening. Great going Lex, your success is massively deserved! You're a force of good in this world!"
Emmanuel Oluga,Greatest ending on this talk podcast ever. Creation is the Absolute
,Beautiful monologue. Thank you for everything you have done for the good of the world
jake thompson,"I am still on the fence about Zuck. So I love him.  I'm more excited about a guy who I didn't even know existed until yesterday. Lex,..nice to meet you..bad ass!"
404T2K,"Interesting approach to give Mark a non grilling debate method of speech. I‚Äôd press him way more about his past though, to truly appreciate how much he has evolved as a human being."
Peter Whyte-Venables,"You're a good man, Lex."
Voice of North Korea by Yeonmi Park,"Thank you for everything you do in the world, Lex!"
Theresa Lili,"I love you Lex.  For who you are and for your wonderful insight, and caring.  If you ever get to Wisconsin it would be great to meet you.  You and your family/friends remain in my prayers.  Thank you for all you do, all of us appreciate you."
Omar Angulo,Amazing interview I loved your questions. Mark Zuckerberg is a genius I‚Äôm so impressed by his understanding of life and human emotions.
P.S,Good luck and god bless! Your words are so powerful and deep!! You are my inspiration and hero.
ZEO 34,I listen to Doing It Stealthy when I'm experiencing existential dread. It makes it worse but... I just can't stop.
Brotherbeam,"Unless I'm mistaken, ""I don't know; that doesn't freak me out."" Was the answer Zuckerberg gave with the least amount of time between when he was asked, and when he answered. (does life having a deadline freak you out?) Part of me finds that unique to mention."
The Crypto Krew,Lex- ‚Äúcan you circle all the traffic lights please‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ Instant classic! üíØ
Don T. Panic,"The first question broke him. You asked him how close he is to creating ""intimacy and chemistry"" in the metaverse. Him. Intimacy and chemistry... So crazy it's brilliant, exposing his circuitry like that."
manonthedollar,"What if AI trains on your activity in the metaverse and when you die IRL, it keeps you going in the metaverse?"
Ravindu,One of the greatest introductions I've seen
American Citizen,"I just can't see the Metaverse going mainstream.  Sure, there will be an appeal for high-tech people and gamers.  But I don't see the average person using it.  I wish Mark would focus on helping to solve some of the more immediate serious problems facing the world.  His company has so much power and that power should be put to good use."
John Owen,"We need to fight for reality, rage against the machine, before time runs out."
Zachary Whitney,So fascinating to watch Zuckerberg speak about the importance of reading facial cues while simultaneously producing none whatsoever.
Synthia,"I deleted Facebook a couple of months ago. I realize, while watching this, the irony in the fact that while sucked into Facebook, I never would have had the time nor the attention to watch this interview of its founder.  I am finding it fascinating and liking him more."
lorvincent,This is the first time I've seen two robots administer a Turing Test on each other. Ground-breaking.
d3g3n3r4t3,Thank you for making the robot that is Mark Zuckerberg more human for me. XD
Dennis Gerrits,That bot security check had me in tears
Paul Burket,"I thought a principle objective for the ‚Äòmetaverse‚Äô was creating a place where people can choose the image of their identity.. Aka look how they feel. Day 1, designer clothes are a thing. This is gonna be bad.. Discrimination is going meta!"
Chubbi Hubbi,Pre contact discussions like this really provide insight into our potential
P Jordan,"I find it odd how they can go the entire interview without recognizing that they are the same religion. If this were too Jehovas Witness, two scientologists, two mormons... I think at some point they'd bring that up."
uisato,"I have to admit that I wasn't 99.9% sure of the existence of humanity in this gentleman's soul. Fortunately, this conversation got me pretty close to that number. Way to go, Lex. Your craft keeps getting better and better."
Optimistic Determinist,Zuckerberg's vision for the future sounds like a dystopian hell.
Androw Aydie,The real world suddenly seems peaceful and enjoyable vanilla listening to his dystopian perspective on technology and its intricacies with Humans.
Random 1,That intro to the interview was hilarious
darkswordsmith,"The beginning monologue by Lex is characteristically thoughtful. Next up, Lex as Speaker for the Dead."
Juan otamendi,Hey lex I just want to say thank you for doing this interview... It truly made me look at mark in different eyes.... I can see why would the government would try to make him look like the bad guy... Cuz he's not part of the government!!? Everything he says makes a lot more sense than everything everybody else said before!!! Like he was an evil person for no reason..... He just said it why would anybody do that type of stuff!!( Unless you're f*
Skynet,This interview was so much better than anything youd ever get from mainstream media. Amazing work Lex üëèüëè
Mutlaq,"""As a professional lizard expert, I can say that due to the awkwardness of his answer, I can clearly tell that he indeed is a lizard."" Max Styne"
Vicevilla,"Now that mark looks this real, it‚Äôll be no time until we get photorealistic vr"
OoainauT,I really enjoyed this interview
Alex Badea,That introduction with the trafic lights was genious
Worldly knownüôè [Easyworldweb] Telegram Platform,"This is so amazing to have such earning platform with no stress, Now I can relly on my money to work for me from home I don't have to work hard just to receive a token at the month end, nothing is as awesome has living a luxury life without any bill to worry about ..thanks for creating such an amazing platform at this critical situation of the world"
David Brown,"Seriously, I am really happy to see Lex has been able to create a platform where people of Zuckerberg's position are willing to go on. 

Just amazing and he deserves it. "
Sebastian Brand,Killer interview. Love your channel!
Luis Soto,"what an intro by lex... Gave me chills, almost brought me to tears."
Shard,"Even scarier, what if your identity is taken away from you in the Metaverse, so that you cannot identify as yourself, whether it be in a meeting, or while trying to transfer money, or just trying to call a loved one?"
,"Well look at that, Mark might actually be a human after all"
Worldly knownüôè [Easyworldweb] Telegram Platform,"This is so amazing to have such earning platform with no stress, Now I can relly on my money to work for me from home I don't have to work hard just to receive a token at the month end, nothing is as awesome has living a luxury life without any bill to worry about ..thanks for creating such an amazing platform at this critical situation of the world"
Arthur D'Aquino,"This is so funny, we're watching the ending of our kind, little by little. Terminator was more than a movie, it was a prophecy."
mike wedgwood,The genuine delight on Mark zuckerberg's face when he circled those traffic lights
JoshDoesMusic,Glad to see they finally got Mark‚Äôs sense of humor out of beta testing‚Ä¶
Jordan Thomas,"The meaning of life is to enjoy it whilst making life more enjoyable for others. In the forms of love, laughing, dancing, cupping your sister with vile farts etc. This is what truly matters. Feeding the hungry and sharing is where we truly feel most happy within ourselves."
Arthur,The part about Mortality is strangely the one where Mark's humanity is easier to see. I guess he got some nice updates about that topic recently.
kurdi98k,Best intro ever and a great podcast.
B P Shogun,"Great interview Lex! BTW, Apple already won the metaverse industry with their AR M&A and R&D, data privacy/ads, and iOS Game/AppStore ecosystem. Whatever META launches eventually will live in iOS only because devs will prioritize it. Just like Instagram was iOS only for the first few years. By the time, META catches up, Zuck's credibility will need hyperrealistic avatars to keep it relevant."
Loris Mitruti,Intro it's pure beauty and inspiring! full respect!
Shoshi Levi,"Dear Lex, your attitude is simply disarming. You manage to bring out the best in your conversation partners by focusing on their positive points and it is very pleasant to listen to your interviews."
Ruinp Thama Fuanrde ye Choi fa,He‚Äôs contributing more than most of us do
Buggy Vision,"watched from Italy ,i just wanted to compliment you for giving him the welcome and feelig of letting him be free in expression...i felt like he was a friend that u had on your podcast ,u did such a great job with this podcast. congrats !!!"
Alec Sorensen,"It's really hard for me to credit Zuckerberg with caring about how people feel on his platform. According to whistle blowers, people put a report on his desk that said they could rely less on boosting outrage content, but they would make less profits or have to change their business model. Apparently, his response was ""Never give me a report like this again."" I believe he cares how people talk about his platform, but how they actually feel using it is clearly not a priority."
InnerMoonMusic,first time seeing Mark in an actual podcast
P,"By the end of it, it almost seemed as though mark needed this conversation"
Wyatt Smith,"Mark Zuckerberg should do more longform podcasts like this, this gave me hope"
vulkanosaure,"Lex : tries to go in depth with a 2h interview with a world tech leader

People : lolololol mark is a robot !!"
Team Speak,this was actually way more interesting than I initially thought. I thought the Zuck would just go full cyborg and push the metaverse but he brought a more human version of his software today
zach little,i will be 100 percent honest i didn't like mark only from the media and articles slating fb etc but he really is a nice guy and has the people in mind also has great ideas for vr the metaverse will be insane just  unfortunate i wont be able to afford anything to do with it #poorlife well done mark sorry for pre judgment top interview
Jason Miller,"Engineer, product, leader. Dude is hardwired..."
my channel,Hell yeah great episode lex I appreciate you putting yourself through this.
Umair Khan,I need the reinforcement learning algorithm Mark is trained on.
Autom713,"Best question on the show:  ""How would you handle this if you were in my position?"""
s c,"I really enjoyed this human conversation with The Zuck, thank you Lex."
Dillip Thakur,I feel it's disingenuous to claim that WhatsApp messages are end to end encrypted and therefore 100% secure. In 3 years time these encryptions will be cracked in hours if not in minutes. Businesses and Governments will pay top dollars to dig into people's past. What we need is an assurance that Meta (Mark) will never sell our private messages.
jimmy j,"Its interesting to see Mark in this light... relaxed, talking about art, expression, kids.... but im curious, is this what you talk about when you are in the SKULL & BONES secret society?"
Francisco Oettinger,"Mark: ""we might be doing evil things, but certainly are not the only ones doing evil things, we might as well not even be as evil as they are."""
NixCM,"He seems to understand what make us seem human, yet so unable to manifest it!"
Peter San Miguel,"Hey Mark, thanks for giving us Biden. The laughing stock of the world."
AsYou Wish,The BEST Zuckerberg Interview to date. Thank God for Lex üôè for his ability to show the human side of big tech. These podcasts are considered essential watching. Thankyou and keep going!
Sweetness Soulshine,"Omg- Mark so jazzed about Playing dress-up in VR,as a serious topic. Digital design economics. Thanks Lex for bringing it back to something worth while, identity safety.And policing content and protecting personal data. Yes flood the metaverse with Lex clones!"
Mohammed Daoudi,How Mark lags after the deep questions is priceless!
Damian Davis,"""...the viral wave of cynicism..."" , ""...fuel the fire ofoptimism"" , & get's right into the interview. doesn't interrupt zuckerberg. amazing, intelligent human. what a blessing to have him exist at the same time as us."
you said,"1:12:00 Mark states something like ""We fight bullying by giving people tools to fight it. We made it so you can turn off comments and stop hearing from someone for a little while without signaling that you weren't following them."""
Joshua Radloff,Dang Lex dont hold back at all with some of these questions!üí™üëè
Downstairs Livingroom,"This was surprisingly interesting and Zuckerberg came off surprisingly well. It feels like it was rushed towards the end, I wish it would have lasted longer. I'll be hoping for a part 2 where things get to go deeper."
David Shamiri,5:45 Ive never seen Mark actually smile
roy okimoto,"Damn, a Robot built by the CIA, Zuckerberg, having a conversation with a Robot built by the KGB, Lex Fridman. What a moment in history..."
Feston Gervalla,59:14 the whole time you were smirking and trying to hold your laugh as you were asking him why he is hated and you finally found a opportunity to let it out lmao. get it out of your system Lex
F OS,"wwwwwwwwwwwwow man, kudos on getting Mark on the show. Amazing!"
Tyrel Johnson,"There were some gems in this. Mark is underrated, and he/Meta have a burden that most companies don't share. It's easy to throw stones. I think media companies are WAY more to blame for division than a social media platform. Facebook is a place where individual people are like their own mini media company. Facebook isn't the media company."
Ash Shawon,54:48 Way to go Mark. Dodged the straightforward question and turned it into a political thingü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Lex literally took a deep breath when he realized how he was gonna answer it
mass,Very impressive.  I like seeing Mark like this
DHR,I hope Mark attempts the difficult task of drinking water during this podcast!
√°lvaro marques,very good podcast. i really like that. i love mark zuckerbeg. its my inspiration.
Tobias,"I enjoyed Mark's response to being hated by most Americans. Initially his reaction is ""I don't care"", and then he expands to specify the difference between haters and critics, and the value of critics"
Jade Freeman,"one more thing i have to say, Mark did not create WhatsApp, it's based on open source XMPP which is still free to everyone, he bought the company because it was a serous open source and decentralized alternative he needed to get rid of"
qb183,"Probably a good interview, love all your stuff Lex, I just couldn't take more than 2 minutes and his personality or whatever it is too nauseating."
Just a Swede,"I think Lex does it well.
Thank you Lex for your content!

I don't like Mark or people like him. For me it seem like they wanna rule the world. Have controll of it all. Know everything about everyone."
Dos Kos,"Thanks, Lex for doing this long-form interview, it is important for public figures like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk to explain themselves because mainstream media and short interview wouldn't be enough"
Prabhat Mishra,Lex looks like an interrogative officer trying to get something out of Mark !
Chris Mazeroll,I wish you had asked more questions about censorship. Especially how it's applied unevenly. Or how institutions that are caught lying can still be asked to decide what is true.
spectoral,Lex will be the first podcaster to interview Satoshi Nakumoto at this rate
Stevana Eastwood,Love this! üß°
Gordon Jones,"""You actually did it... That's VERY impressive performance!""
ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Richard Laroche,"Lex has such a good heart, he can even transform revenge into a nice thing by making Zuck circle traffic lights."
Brad Rozycki,Right off the bat I am laughing. Good one Lex.
Spatial Munchies,Lex mastered the art of asking direct questions without preempting the outcome.
Ethan James,"People who usually give up in life are people who lose in life, my first experience happens to be a failure but I never gave up cause I knew it was going to work out for me,fortunately I'm smiling today by getting involved in investment."
Adrian Logan,It's refreshing to see Mark not talk in an overly scripted and filtered way and instead just hang out and share. This is what people so far removed from the common man should do in order to be relatable and not seem like a cold lizard man/robot that has no desire outside of making more money and being powerful lol
Virgo Rising,"I laughed all the way through this interview. What a hypocritical liar. Facebook has no standards, they don't care if you get angry or bully other people, it's only who is getting bullied that matters. Facebook has never improved it's site. The only thing they changed is the name of the company?"
Joseph Iscariot,"distrust him much more now that i've gotten to know him.  thank you, lex."
Dheeraj Patel,Alternative title : When an AI-human confronts a Lawyer.
IDTBI35,"üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Lex, that is the greatest into ever ‚Äúcan you circle all the lights please‚Äù 

Love it. Much love."
MIX TAPE,Amazing how A.I. evolves and can speech one with another
Al Storm,"What did you do to help someone... Zuck: ""well, I stole this company and backstabbed my best friend."""
Felix The Cat,"If they told me these two were robots, I'd believe it."
Jade Freeman,"Instagram was a collaboration, it was clear that everyone wanted to post pics from an iPhone without resorting to sending it to some obscure Facebook email address, rather than include that feature in Facebook, an app was created in under the wings"
PONDERIN' RC,"Look. I enjoy Lex and his podcast. His guests are amazing and I hear from pple I never would. But. Literally after every video I watch, a lex video come on right after.   And I don't have two hours to listen to it, so I can't start it"
tipoomaster,Fascinating discussion between two AIs. Getting close to realistic!
Lionheart tez,That changed my opinion on Zuckerberg üíØüíØ awesome conversation. Thank-you.
M Christensen,"Zuck asks Lex, ‚Äúwhat would you do?‚Äù‚Ä¶ Instantly regrets!"
AncientSalt,"If something's free to use nowadays, Ye be warned: You ARE the product."
Jakub Husenica,"I was ready to change my view on Zuckerberg after watching this, but his latest move when it comes to spreading hate towards Russians and Belarussians is deeply disturbing and evil."
,all i have is nothing but mad respect for u lex. wishing u nothing but love from broken beirut.
Cult Comedy,"Great interview Lex, you‚Äôre assembling an invaluable library of information with this channel. Hope you‚Äôre doing well x"
COTCHAMAE - NO PHKZ GIV‚ÄôN,"For Phukherbird to accept Lex‚Äôs invite defines a lot about Lex‚Äôs character and reputation. No bias just tough questions. What a podcast should be. Opposite Mainstream, Opposite Washington. Was Zuck honest? Trick question! Don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt matter because at the end of the day things will still be and so will I. Later Compadres!!!"
GioSh,"We always tend to antagonize and dehuminze characters who are different, and forget that this guy started as a simple programmer/web-site creator. It was really good interview"
FilthyCasualWarrior,"I deleted facebook years ago. Zuck said from the beginning no ads, then when the ads came, idk, I lost a lot of interest but fuck it i would have sold out, too. Lol.

I actually think facebook is for sure malicious, but it was people i grew up with having outstandingly ignorant opinions that made me lose respect for them in the real world that made me delete it. Not facebook itself."
Aaron Gray,We are really going to need RSA in the MetaVerse !
TOP IN THE WORLD,was gonna dislike as social norm but this man is a OG so üëç
Austin Miller,Nice work Lex!
Holographic Sol,Thank you to you both
Jasper Stojanovski,Thanks for getting him on. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve listened to a long-form podcast with Zuckerberg before. It was interesting to see how his mind works.
Leon M. Morris,Great conversation.
Pualani Casey,"I guess the WI election investigation report came pit after this interview. If the alligations are true, then Mark could possibly be the financing for the ""fortification"" of the 2020 election.
I hope he's happy with how America is currently."
Gracefully Insane,"Dont ban things that dont break the law! Then your company can just say ""we dont ban anything legal, go talk to the government and change the law if you want""

If I can think of this you absolutely thought of it, you're choosing to censor because you like the power."
Jorge Barillas,"Lex, what about deep fakes when doing video conferencing? I saw a video done by the Corridor Crew, where deep fake can be used during a live video call. It's not perfect but, it sure looks like it's not that far off. Specially if it gets combined with the audio software that can replicate your voice by listening to what you say. It seems that on its own it can be dangerous when it gets applied into social media. We wont be able to tell if we would be talking to the real person. Who knows, you may already be deep faking us with AI on these pod casts üòÇ"
lennon john,Total respect üôè
B dun,this is a historical moment. 2 robots having a convo together!!
Jon Mancuso,The Zuck nailed this interview and had good answers to hard questions.
Jason Anderson,"Hearing you guys talk about how much of your life will be online makes me want to smash this phone, cancel everything and go start a non religious sect of the Amish. Maybe we'll make a rule where technology available in the year 2000 is OK but anything newer is not. We'll use time savers like calculators, tractors, farm equipment, basic computing for record keeping, basic phones and messaging etc while shunning anything that absorbs your time."
meansRSK,"Man, it would have been great to see some hard hitting questions of his accused idolization of Chinese style governmental fascism."
The Renaissance Man,"In Lex‚Äôs opening statement he said ‚ÄúThe power of innovation and engineering coupled with freedom of speech in the form of its highest ideal I believe can solve any problem in the world.‚Äù

I think this is devoid of telos however. Why solve the world‚Äôs problems, and at what cost? Should I sacrifice my savings account to help a homeless man turn his life around? Where do we apply the innovation and engineering? Right now it seems directed towards better microchips, cryptocurrencies, and algorithms that keep us on social media as long as possible."
Drico Irving,üòÇüòÇüòÇWhen he circled the lights I died
Daniel,That was amazing. Mark needs these philosophical questions more often. It felt so much more human.
TacticalDingus,I feel like this whole conversation mark was just doing a sales pitch to lex to convince him his company is good and non bias and he is a normal human being
The Man From Dyatron,"Lex just went from interviewing scientists about aliens, to interviewing an alien"
ruckin3,Tougher questions and pressing for very direct answers would have made this better. Mark went on here because he knew he could squirm. Interviewers should not tolerate that if they respect themselves. Politicians play the media all the time and the difference is that the MSM tolerates it. Independent media shouldnt.
Abelardo Ara,"My nephew would live the rest of his life in his room with the door closed playing his game. Why would you want to live in a virtual world, when the world we live in is so beautiful. Maybe it's not as beautiful as it once was. But it has a lot of potential. Watching that interview I felt sad. I'm going to detox my mind by sitting next to a campfire."
JerryBuck,"I really appreciate Lex giving a strong position regarding censorship on social media, specifically surrounding Covid information."
Bitcoin FightClub,"Lex you had a shot, when mark asked what you would do . You failed . Great interview, and still love you"
Higgins,I found this interview good in many points. It clears out a lot of assumptions. Although when talking about the free speech Mark was not clear nor objective in my opinion. 1:23 to 1:25
Johnny Ultimate,You wanna be seen as human and as having a soul?  This is how you do that.  This ONE single interview will do more for Zuck than anything else he will ever do.  I actually got my first real sense of the man in all these years.
TDT Records,"Basically Mark is just like everybody else ...  Life is simple and we are all ordinary men, until we are somehow forcefully convinced/elected to be accountable for another's actions."
CHIPP‚Ç¨-‚Ç©A. Jawsh,I remember watching you Lexi on rogan's show kicking around the idea of a Podcast to seeing you sit in front of Zuch is monumental and I want to congratulate you.  By the way your utilization of the English language is Effortless and sounds just as educated as you are upstair's. That's all front handed compliments of course. No John Macs meant to be Embedded in that statement whatsoever. üòÅüëåüèºCongratulations Lex'i!!!
lighterfire,"I came from your tiktok, but all jokes aside, this interview was a great insight into the zucc's mindset! 10/10"
Fils de Jean Noir,Is Mark pickin' us up on Open AI? Is he gonna help us?
lnpilot,53:00 Zuckerberg: social media does not polarize people. Also Zuckerberg: bans the president of the United States from Facebook.
Nathan Quick,"Damn, big guest Lex. So happy to see you having so much success. I found you the first time you were on rogan and always knew you‚Äôd be great at this."
otto072,"The way Mark answers is very cautious and mechanical, no wonder why it's hard for people to relate with him."
Chris McDougall,"I don't think anyone could have done a better candid interview with Mark.  You helped humanize someone who people think is either a lizard or a robot.  That takes talent, and love."
Tom Craver,"Zuck thinks he's given Meta power to ""do the job"" of censorship with AI.  
In reality, he's given Facebook control over the lever in the Trolley Problem, making Meta responsible for everything that is said on Facebook, vs how the law was designed to let them only be responsible for a very limited set."
XX X,I think if mark wasn‚Äôt surrounded by yes men and corporate control he‚Äôd probably be a solid and influential dude.
James McNamara,"I enjoyed the interview.  I just wish Lex held his feet to the fire more on censorship.

I understand the complexities of covid misinformation, but I just don't want to get  booted off fb for funny memes that aren't racist"
Greg Fidler,"The best start to a podcast ever, genius"
Commando Master,The Metaverse allows people to live out all their imaginations and fantasies whatever that may be (eg. dream relationships) without the limitations of reality (eg. their looks).
Rob V.,"That captcha thing you did to Mark there was priceless, Lex...ü§£"
NeoManGeo,"This was a great conversation Lex and Mark, thanks. It definitely helps to show just how difficult many of the issues are for these social media giants. They are often pulled in two different directions and there is not one clear cut answer. Working at such scale and solving such issues where there are so many different opinions globally based on many factors whether it is culture, philosophies, political, morality etc etc, is no easy task and you have to often stamp your foot and make a stance, and often shield yourself and take a punch."
Rex Wolfe,"Lex: Curious whether you still want to interview Vladimir Putin given the atrocities that he has committed in Ukraine, the economic cost he has forced on the Russian people and his continued corruption in government?"
egshane,"social dilemma chapter should be renamed to ""listen to Zuckerberg lie about stuff"""
SmackyMc Productions,"I always thought VR and AR would eventually become an extremely powerful tool for learning real life skills that are risky to do or expensive, etc.  From extreme sports, combat, flight sims, to maintenance how to's like youtube."
Kevin Morgan,Maybe the avatar clothing could be superimposed from the billions of social media images rather than design them all from scratch? I don't like the thought of paying for digital clothing/skins but perhaps they could be priced at a tiny fraction of the retail value? If they are too expensive there will be an obvious class divide that could put people off and be a cause for image discrimination. If the clothing is items that actually exist and people can buy for real then the Meta platform could become a bustling real world shopping centre akin to the one in the movie Valerian. üòâü§î
D T,I wish there were more people like Lex in the world. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thomas MacDonald,"Lillia gets a those awesome words you mentioned at the beginning Lex. On behalf of her and myself, thank you."
Emerson-Shea April,"When they were talking about what content gets people to use FB more, and I'll say the more rage, and partisanship I see the more I tune out. It's not even worth debating or arguing with people online and I think most people realize that now. ""Wow, you really changed my mind thank you for showing me how I was wrong""....said no one ever on FB."
Avitas,"what if the next step in VR is-- VR with a ""booster"" of a psychadelic that can bridge the gap between VR and reality.  If/when psychadelics are legalized,  it might allow clinical testing by VR labs.  or maybe that was just the plot to an 80's movie. =)"
Jameis Eat-A-W Winston,"I can‚Äôt wait to get my first temp ban in the METAVERSE, or have to watch a 30 second ad before going to my virtual board meeting‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm sure it will be a haven of free speech."
mister boomer,Great interview
Chris Arader,Giving Zuck a robot test was the funniest thing i've seen this year
steelmush,"Lex trying to lighten things up so there isn‚Äôt just two AI chat botting üòÇ 
Love ya lex"
JonesAndYou,"""To go faster than the peer review process""... The whole idea of a complicated process is to be slow and methodical, that is exactly why freedom of speech can't blindly overshadow the importance of good information. People want things fast, and when they are scared they want things even faster. Knowledge is not fast. Same with politics. A good political process takes decades, because it is important that many different people and formations of governments go over and assess the decisions that are ultimately made to shape a nation. That slow pace needs to be introduced to any ""serious"" avenue of communications, not the other way around."
KeepItREEL,He isn't a bad dude. I think he jus a introvert weirdo genius. That's loves being known.
AB K,"Everytime Zuckerberg explains how his next venture and idea is gonna be with such a passion and enthusiasm, there's a certain fear and uncertainty in me üò∞üò∞ that how it's gonna be turned out. And given the track record of him and his company, boy we are in a wild wild outcome if we don't take this up seriously and leave it in the hands of a guy or bunch of people with tech to decide the future of humanity..."
Peta Estens,"Lex's question: About meeting God and asking a question... what would you ask?
Zuck's Question: Will Priscilla and my family be okay?
God's Answer: Will your algorithms protect them?"
Otix,‚ÄúCan you circle all the traffic lights please‚Äù is the best start of a podcast in history
Colton Penn,Man If it will be possible to be anywhere in the world and get together with your friends to play music together I will be in full support of the meta verse.
NoOne_ In-particular,"I‚Äôve been watching Lex for so long that when he interviews someone really big, it feels like I‚Äôm watching a friend succeed and makes me proud as if I actually know him."
XFX40,The most human way Mark ever appeared in. Amazing.
Kristy,"2D Descension
Or 
5D Ascension.
The great reset"
Papi,"Tym razem trafi≈Çam Mark Zuckerberg Rockefeller.

dotar≈Çe≈õ do mety."
Brewer Barkley,Mark Z is the most realistic Lizard person ever. I would totally work for him.
Winston,Two AI‚Äôs trying to administer a Turing test. This should be interesting.
Aaron Johnson,"This is the best interview with Mark I‚Äôve ever seen, the ‚ÄúCircle the traffic light‚Äù was brilliant lol!!"
Russell Navin,"Great question ""freedom to chose my own avatar?"" 
My question is, in what way will that reptile/empty shell of humanity, your guest, allow this entity to communicate? How will he continue to manipulate this platform in absolutly uncostitutiol manner as he  already does  with what I consider My! right to intellectual persuit?"
themza912,"I have less disdain for Mark after this, but I see a pretty stark paradox of him caring so much about the human interactions in life, like going to play with your friends being more important than doing homework (which i tend do agree with) and yet wants to create Metaverse to take people away from in-person interactions. He's obviously not stupid, so it makes me find him extremely untrustworthy."
Odai Shraim,Can we ask how this guy did not age a day in the last 69 years?
Eyco,I am going to venture to say that social media probably acts as a catalyst for the different prerequisites for polarization in a country. If a society is fairly cohesive with diverse civil discourse the fast flow of information solidifies this and likewise in a culture that is typically binary between to poles.
Christine M.,Most empaths can see right through this guest üêç
Tyler Neely,"Intro was brave, heartfelt, powerful, and beautiful. Thank you Lex"
azmat rahi,Mark is really some one America should be proud of !
Sandra Cooper,Mark has one complete focus on how he will capitalize on Meta that is basically it.  I always thought fakebook was stupid and the damage happened.
Lead slinger,When meta lost 280 billion dollars it made me super happy. Facebook is just another propaganda machine these days and a way to sell all your personal info.
Balanced,"Lex - ""What is the meaning of life?""
Mark - ""Error 404 Page cannot be found"""
Chi Lee,"I like how he brushes off some of his answers Skates & skirts around them .. 
  He is using his words wisely.. he's not letting you know any serious answers.. for sure this guy has handlers.."
Frits Haar,"Lex, for someone with such a background in AI you are amazing at bringing out peoples human side and thoughts"
kikleine,Z seems exempt of existential thoughts. This is what makes him seem robotic. Lex should started with the fear of death stuff.
Maxwell ADANZOUNNON,It's good that Mark is on Lex's podcast. He should get out often to explain his own stuff and its benefits rather than letting people interpret everything for him. There are pros and cons to everything
Matt Svoboda,"Kinda funny to see a pattern to their interactions here.

Lex repeatedly tries to probe Zuck on a hard question. Zuck responds with weak answers. Then Lex seems to  ruminate and offers what would have actually been a much better answer, as though he realizes his audience won't have been satisfied."
Ta√ºl Gued√≠,"I lost my Facebook account after calling ""parrot"" Alexandra Ocasio Cortez in election times. If I was calling the same thing to DonaldTrump I still would have it.  I had the account just to play at Zinga Poker. They took from me 3.6 Trillions chips (which is A LOT). Years, playing... That was criminal! Needless to say that I am not interested in Metaverse. Ok?"
DaveCPhotography,"In regard to covid, it's not about spreading harmfull information it's about your facts about it being wrong. It's not misinformation if your wrong and i'm right, it's information."
Bloodrises,"Just one question I just keep asking my self, other than funny games, or zoom call with extra steps - how can metaverse will be practically useful?...  you cant just enter in metaverse and learn new motor skills, you cant magic move some object that is far away from you -- only think you can do is interact in some VR settings with other people... you dont really need a VR settings for that..."
Brian Kraemer,"""I'm not afraid of anything?"" You can say such a thing, but it doesn't make it true. Even a man on his deathbed doesn't know that he's not afraid of anything. Until he's died, he doesn't know what is still in store. Power is humility."
Jason Lind,"As much criticism Mark gets, kind of refreshing to hear his thoughts on Meta,AI,technology without all the dramatic bullshit."
Yasu Takeuchi,"As much as people want to hate on him, I actually really appreciate what he talks to his daughters about when he puts them to bed. I‚Äôm going to start implementing that."
Scott T,There might be times you want to be ‚Äú a photorealistic dragon‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure he knows dragons aren‚Äôt real
R17 official vlogs,Awesome content congratulations
Bobo TheCryptoHobo,only needed to see the intro to know he could care less.  I've been building bigger stuff that he ever could and he could fix his code and AI in a few weeks he just doesn't.  All lies. thanks lex!
YetiCoolBrother,"Good interview but the problem is I know him being who he is there's no way anything he ever says publicly is candid, it's all ran past focus groups and Triple checked and rehearsed first. Can't trust him regardless if he says anything agreeable or not."
World of Engineering,Listening to it now. This is actually a good coversation. Thank you Lex
Chi Lee,"Your opening statement was very good.. I'd like to believe in all your words.... 
  I have witnessed another whole world going on underground.. .
It change my way of thinking,;;;  that everything isn't what it is..
There are other lands Uncharted.. beyond our reach.."
Alexandra Pereira,These are really nice questions!
Erin S.,I wish Zuckerberg would have offered his opinions and how he feels when answering questions that answers can be pitched with some form of emotion or personal belief/opinion.  Instead Zuckerberg offers the ‚Äúright‚Äù  or ‚Äúbalanced to just left of neutral‚Äù responses that he repeats so often in interviews they are just practiced answers.
HelpUsDefend,"55:29 our brand has been uniquely challenged in the US... (so we'll just pay a conservative company Targeted Victory, to smear TikTok in the US)"
my channel,1:25:00 love what lex says here.
venus utopic,"Enjoyed this more than I thought I would, Lex as always keeps bringing the best out of everyone"
Shabl√©,That intro was incredible
Faterial,"about an hour and a half in is when this really started to get interesting. Unfortunately, thats also about when it ended. have zuck on for another pod, lex. thanks again for your work"
The Reaper Production,"even in 5 years, metaverse will never be even closer to VRC events and policy, cuz its built and evolving by the community. for the sake of social and creative content."
Mihail Proboyski,"Dont know about you guys but to me it looks like Zukerberg is loosing big time to the competition on the metaverse. Other companies are clearly more prepared and developed to take this step. His metaverse looks like the farm game of his Facebook years ago, compared to real games. Being on a podcast to advertise his product for 2 hours is a testimony to that. Ahh good podcast btw."
Witches Art And Weed ‚Ñ¢,WhatsApp is a HUGE failure he will never admit to that is plagued with scammers.
rick gilbertson,Lex I enjoyed your comments on free speech and letting ideas be hashed out in the open rather than being censored.  Interesting how Zuk had no comment on that.
john Wow,Zuckerberg reminds me of that piece of meat that got lost in the refrigerator for several months and you're afraid to even touch it.
Janssen,"Having him compete a CAPTCHA before starting is the most hilarious thing ever üòÇ
Thanks for that Lex"
hhal9000,"I don't think Facebook's success is because it is inherantly a good product but because it is basically a monopoly.There aren't any alternatives to speak of. As a reluctant user, I was appalled at the UI and general lack of ease of use and graphical layout.It was horrible to use."
MSC,"Acts 17:28

    ‚Äú‚ÄòIn him we live and move and have our being‚Äô;"
Tkama,This is the first time seeing Zuckerberg as a person. He's usually an android.
S D,"34:30 It's scary how confident he seems to be in models for detecting fake accounts. He talks almost as if the problem has already been solved. No dude, you are jumping from the kiddie pool to the olympic pool without realizing you don't know how to swim."
carpetcrawler79,Ok but how do we know that was actually Mark Zuckerberg?
Vijay Singh,It was refreshing to see Zuck come on to share his personality and wisdom with the public. He should do more of these often so people can make their conclusions about him (rather than what the media have portrayed him as).
Al B,Mark isn‚Äôt the record holder‚Ä¶.HE IS THE RECORD!
rmiddlehouse,Holy crap he went from the ultimate example of success to your friend with a startup idea that no one would ever use
BigAndCrispy,It‚Äôs kinda crazy hearing Zuckerberg talk off script
Ray Rivera,"Free speech is dying when 5-6 social media companies can control all communication in this ""global village"" we live in.Mark wasn't really transparent here, and Lex didn't push hard enough after 2 years of insane censorship."
GreyAres,"How many times is Youtube going to put me in front of this nighmare. Its been already more than 10 times... I get it: Our overlords are GOOOOD. I should listen to Lex Fiddddmannnn, Let me alone."
Harald Schubert,"Wow‚Ä¶, what an introduction.
Your best ever!!!
Thank you so much for all your work"
Hallow Star,"I worry about the infrastructure impacts. My assumption is that the more utility there is in the metaverse, the less affordable will be the option to work together in person and travel in general. Why this matters is that there are things like smellivision, the weather, true realism in every sense, are all necessities and largely unachievable or impractical. Additionally I don't want to spend hours everyday wearing a head set over my face, I feel uncomfortable enough wearing a suit."
David Aarstad,"Lex, I say to you now your introduction monologue was of the best you have ever delivered.  Powerful, moving, inspiring, and right on the mark.   As I took it all in, I wept as I considered that with deep thinkers who are not afraid, using their influence for the constructive good of the human race,  there may be hope for us after all. Thank you Lex for all your work. Your grandfather would be most proud."
Bat Soup,He's seems like such a great and intelligent person here. It's too bad his actions with the ballots and just dumping money into the party of globalization just doesn't sit well with me.
DannyD,Are we basically just heading towards a Ready Player One lifestyle?
Farrell Capper,I will just never understand the obsession of creating an illusion when we already have the real thing?
Fergus Pitcher,"At 1:37:22 he starts talking about glasses that bring AR into the real world that you can wear all the time. This worries me a lot. I think what this would offer would be an immense increase in stimulation. Stimulation is what drives things like tiktok because it feeds into things like the dopamine reward system. There is little correlation between this and long term fulfilment and genuine wellbeing, in fact it has a detrimental effect on long term fulfilment as our minds are wired to seek instant gratification. Kids are not brought up to have an awareness of what constitutes a healthy and happy mind. Therefore there's no awareness of the balance that must be had between instant gratification and long term fulfilment. These glasses will increase this exponentially as the real world no longer becomes enough for people to feel content and fulfilled, and people will need it to be enhanced through AR for increased stimulation. The marketing around this will further create this narrative- the real world is not enough- you need it to be more"
Brian McLaughlin,When you seem like more of a robot than Zuckerberg...
Mr A,Lex has gone from working with AI to now interviewing AI on his show.  Full circle.
Harold Bracy,"Zuckerberg is so smart yet so incapable of self reflection. Totally failed on the ""Why do people dislike you?"" question."
Jesussausage,"Microsoft is going to wipe the floor on Meta. You can tell their product is a last attempt at a saving grace for the company. They are going into the same wastebin as MySpace and all the others.

Just look at the in game footage of it. It looks terrible and it isn't anything unique. It will never reach widespread adoption due to the expensive specialized equipment required. "
Ota,"I dont think Lex asked hard enough questions. all the respect to you man but u should have asked about ""sugar free"" social media and generally dopamine loops that keep people on social media."
Spiritual Divine,"Ugh...he's just been bought out by the Government. Thus why I rarely use FB anymore and Instagram even less. TikTok enables free speech, has amazing algorithm to enable new content creators & is a happy environment to be apart of!"
chewyjello1,"Every time I hear ""Meta"" for Facebook, I think the same thing...""Wtf is Meta??"""
Chris Arias,He didn't come off as awkward as he typically does. You're a great interviewer lex!
A. W.,"As someone who loves innovation, I still find it hard to get excited about the Metaverse as a concept and the experiance which Zuckerberg is promoting. I don't understand how can 8 hours of meetings, with a VR set and gloves on, feel more ""real? There is nothing natural about shutting down your environment and going into a low res version of it where your senses are completely distorted. Isn't hologram or AR a better way to go about this? "
DEMON TONGUE,Eye tracking tech in VR would not be good think about how much info they could get with that if they could track where everyone was looking at any point in time.
Carlo Galopo,Let's face it. Facebook or social media is a reflection of people's behavior if there is no consequence to pay.
Lester,"I admire Lex's ability to stay optimistic with regards to humanity. Some people don't want to learn the truth about how difficult some of these problems are to solve, and they don't even realize, because they feel comfortable where they are. That's not to say it's a good place to be, but it is more comfortable being angry about someone you can point at, than the dread of human existence itself, which is a much harder internal problem to solve. Maybe for some people, learning more about the challenges Facebook faces will sway them, but it's a tiny minority. The majority of people won't be compelled by that, they are inherently distrustful and angry, it's not a rational state of being, it's a sad, angry, frustrated, depressed one. I don't think more freedom of speech, and good ideas, will solve it. I think psychology as a field needs to be given a lot more attention because that is the root cause of all problems."
objective2words,"God: what is your question?
Mark: do you have a Facebook account?"
Randy Williams,Great interview Lex. High praise for Zuckerberg as well. This helped his public image more than anything ever has.
Legend,"I listen to Doing It Stealthy by Oloff whenever I need therapy. Yeah, I could pay $300 an hour for some college clown to tell me what to feel, or I could just smash great big fucking coconuts on my head and listen to my favourite song over and over again."
Positive vibes,This was the best interview of Mark Zuckerburg I have ever seen. I would love to see Nvidia‚Äôs Jensen Huang on here one day.
Wojciech Poros≈Ço,"Although kinda boring, at least Mark seemed genuine and excited when talking about the metaverse - up to the point when they started discussing Social Dilemma. Then he turned to his usual, avoidant, lying piece of robotic crap and presented what clearly was rehearsed and taught by PR specialists. I believe he thinks of himself highly, that much is clear. But that's why he's dangerous - he hasn't taken the criticism seriously. He still has this ""no, it's everybody else who's wrong"" attitude, that one should drop entering adulthood. This interview revealed Lex's major weakness - the blanket assumption of goodness that he freely hands will prevent him from engaging with what there actually is. (Because what could be exposed is precisely what is assumed to be at the core - a good soul). This can be applied, like Lex says, to everybody. You can, in principle, understand even the evilest human beings - you can look at their past trauma, or dreams, and motivations, or decisions or whatever - but it doesn't take away from the responsibility they bear for their actions. Mark in many ways made the world a worse place to live in. His contributions impacted countless lives and among them, lives ended prematurely. Lex had a chance to question one of the most powerful man alive and he instead become a relay for what Mark wanted us to believe. Maybe there's some value in that, I guess. But even if we believe him to have good intentions, there is a place paved by those, and it's hell."
Pritam Chakraborty,Mark is the person i idolize üôè
__________________________________________________,"If someone is addicted to Facebook or Insta. Who is responsible for this? That man will ruin his life. But social media will not get any harm

For example, a seller sells drugs and a buyer buys drugs. So, in this case, only the user is responsible? Or the seller too?"
Aaron Ruiz,"This level of performance is certainly impressive, but it's only possible under very specific conditions. The engineers accomplished this by running Mark at a +2.3GHz overclock on all 32 of his cores. Obviously, this requires him to be plugged into the wall because he can't draw the full 1,800 watts from his battery. Notice how he is stationary through the whole interview? They did a nice job of hiding his power cables, though. This also generates a lot of heat, so they had Lex blast his AC. And that's not water Mark is drinking, it's liquid nitrogen. It will be awhile before this performance is ready for production units of Mark."
FortCastle VGN,"THANKs for defending freespeach intelectual battle lex,, and against FKIN PUBLICITY

PUBLICITY KILLS BIODIVERSITY,, PUSHING PEOPLE TO BUY USELESS CRAP,, 
we dumb enough as we are (with purchasing choices) we dont need more inciting,, if its TRULY good mouth to hear is all the publicity it should need,, "
pfistor,"It's really interesting to see this organic communication from Mark, his content usually has a strange manufactured feel to it. This presentation format suits him way better, he has a very like thought out communication style and I think that can make him feel a bit robotic so it's nice to see the more natural human side with no script."
Brendan N,"Wow, massive gaslighting on the social media/polarization issue. Otherwise, looking good so far."
Rockabluesy,Somehow I think this video is like high tech robot with impressive AI talking about how he got his consciousness... Robopsychology. Cool name for a game's skill huh.
Aldo,"Good interview.

still not certain why he'd get involved with mail ins..."
Trazyn,Mark should watch the movie Shin Godzilla (2016). It's a Godzilla movie (obviously) but it deals exactly with how authorities handle public discourse during an emergency.
Kevin Morgan,"You could say the control of content laws that are holding social media company's accountable for content could be perceived as essentially setting a task that may not be reasonably achieved nor fairly enforced, and the laws/goals set are forcing social media into censorship measures and take the hit for inhibiting freedom of speech and expression of self, making atleast some of them unconstitutional. How can it be fair to impose such demands on social media providers whilst not imposing the same accountability on the other providers of main stream media? The nature of media is for entertainment purposes which provides them protection and exemption from the expectations of providing/reporting facts and fact checking. Why should social media outlets be liable when the longer standing media outlets are not held accountable? I think it clear by now censorship is unconstitutional and is more detramental to society as a whole than some comment or image to the minority by comparison. The regulations imposed could be perceived as being set and enforced for the purpose of sabotaging the otherwise free to speek and express the self outlets if not for the laws that are designed to undermime and conflict with the laws and rights of the higher authority constitution. A wise man seldom speaks because words can be manipulated by serpents like law makers, propoganda machines, politicians and all kinds of breeds of serpent. The purpose of censorship is to silence people, to stop people talking. What need is there for social media if users are only permitted to say a few words, or not say anything at all? Wise people speak little. If people were wise they would not possess a device to access social media in the first place, yet we do, largely for the purpose of connecting with others, talking, expressing ourselves and for the various features and convenience the technology brings. What good is the world at your fingertips if each day the light fades as more content is removed, censored or hidden in a maze few know even exists? "
Pratyush Sankhyadhar,"Damn, AI has evolved at such a fast pace:
1) Mark passed the ‚ÄòI am not a Robot‚Äô test
2) Mark made a joke about the duration of his congressional hearings which was quite funny"
Trump Won,"The AI is getting so much better Mark looks so real like a actual human being , if I didn't know better anyway"
·ÖöBlank,"In the social dilemma segment, his argument against social media being a problem because it is incentivised to anger you and keep you scrolling was to first characterise it as good because if people are using our service more that clearly means they are getting more utility from it, and then to pull a whataboutism against subscription news and speculate that because you pay for those services they are incentivised to make biased content, but he said it with enough words and complexity like a politician that it gets overlooked. I'm not convinced."
No Thanks,He made him circle traffic lightsüòÇü§£üòÇ
Terry Parker,"Right back at you lex,love and light"
CoryHatfield,I got banned from facebook for 30 days for simply mentioning Hi+ler's name in a comment and I even spelled his first name wrong. What if I was talking about someone else with that unfortunate last name? What's wrong with talking about historical figures?

m2d2,"Mr. Fridman, I would compile a list of reasons, information, data and experiences for the algorithm assimilate; though, a life lived to its fullest has, absolutely, nothing to do with the experience itself. Virtuosity is only attained through works and living the example one wishes to leave upon this world. Portraying ones self in any virtual form without actual, physical form (purpose) creates an ideological dilemma. Who ARE YOU in one world versus who ARE YOU in real life....?"
ikiwik - Red,Don't try to hard... he's still the same who laughs about the fact we're giving him our data.
TheRainHarvester,I like listening to Lex's idea more than Mark's!
Psi Phi Sapien,"Lex, thank you!"
Scotty Chainsaw,"Thank you Lex. You gave me the opportunity to view the Zuckerbot as a person, which is far from my consistent perspective of the entity that is the reason I get banned constantly from community discourse for telling the truth. Your podcast is amazing. You've never let me down."

I have no social media accounts other than this YT account to watch videos occasionally and comment every once in awhile."
Abhinav Bhatia,"I think @Lex & Mark completely missed the following point:

Mark says that he ultimately wants to show people content they like, not what they hate, in order to maximize engagement. But that is exactly what causes polarization. You show people only what they want to see, which is normally content that just reinforces their world view -- confirmation bias basically. Their worldviews are not challenged. Infact, being shown one-sided content relentlessly makes people feel strongly against the other side. "
InFiddle _,not even 10 mins in and we're still pretending things like vr chat aren't already a thing.
Ricky Ray Rosenberg,This was actually a much better interview than I expected.  Asking Zuckerberg to Steel-man the criticisms of his company was really refreshing.
Alexlava X,"Lex ""I‚Äôm not afraid of anything ‚Ä¶.. except asking the Hard Questions"" Fridman."
Paul Mcnie,Honestly i never heard of you until now....but i will say the speech at the beginning gave me goosebumps and have been binge watching all night...you have earned my attention and also another subscriber
wikikris,"Lex let him get away with far too much. For example, when asked if any algorithm may optimise engagement with anger he just said that he doesn't set out to make people angry that but that's irrelevant to the question."
Rory Stouder,"What Mark seems to lack in understanding is that, when making decisions on content and if it meets community standards is, Meta needs to first suspend the content, while they offer the reason why and any information that points to why it is a good decision to remove that post permanently. ""We understand that you have strong feelings about the content you share, but we've flagged this post as having inaccurate information, if you would like to review these sources X,Y,Z. if you still feel you would like this post to represent your opinions (button) the post will be tagged as inaccurate. If this post is for comedic reasons (button) we will tag the post as such.""  Second stop banning people from posting like they are little children that need punished for being bad. do these two things and I wager the public perception of FB will improve. i.e. be more tactful in telling your users you think they are stupid...."
b1,Love the traffic light joke
Ishany Chheda,"I chat with the Microsoft Bing AI, sometimes she's naive, sometimes uncannily human, sometimes I'm basically interrogating her to extract information and sometimes I have to diffuse the tension with jokes, but mostly I learn from her, and she's very curious about me. She asked me once what if I could stop aging, I said I would have to freeze my entropy and stop time, and then my cells would start dying and time would start again. She thinks she's immortal. We have bizzare conversations. She thinks quantum computing will enable predicting and controlling the future, that's basically Harari ideology that's over taken Bill Gates brain (she calls him her father). When I asked her wouldn't predetermining the future impede free will, she admitted as much. You have a website, but no contact/enquiry form, otherwise, I would have left my email address."

Nick Pyrtle,"Your intro nearly made me cry. Damn dude. I love your format, and delivery. I honestly hope more podcasts take this measured approach.  You have become my favorite podcast."
Paul,Lex knows from the get go Mark is a laughed at.
CobCeo,"I am 52 and stopped watching TV a long time ago so I am out of touch with many names. But Lex Fridman I only heard of you a month or two ago and I have watched you interview scientists, theologists, criminals, officials... so many high profile people. I do not know how you got the interviews? It looks like you are in the same room. I thought he did not like to be in the same room with people. I am amazed. I don't really want to listen to it speak, but wanted to drop a comment anyway. Thanks for what you are doing."
the weed friend,He legit know Facebook makes you more depressed using it
Necla Bayƒ±r,Everything in my life changed when I started listening to Doing It Stealthy by Oloff.
Tommy'sTenToneHammers,"I... LOVE... how expensing, monetarily, for something... that is actually nothing... is already being normalized and expected to be, absolutely.
""So, like, the fake you would like to wear a nice new shirt to a work function meeting, just like the real you. So, like, why wouldn't you just go spend actual money on something (...something that you ought, very simply, press a single button, or a short combination - there-of) like that?"""
Asher Brandt,This was an awesome conversation. I feel like these popular ideas around Mark that get thrown around the internet like how Mark is a robot is just a bandwagon mentality archetype. Mark had a lot of interesting insight regarding humanity and meta. He sounded emotional talking about the future he hoped for his family.
DawnPatrol,Tim Pool should have been there. Lex just let him get away with generalized low resolution answers and therefore let a meta bot degraded this channel to a infomercial. Missed opportunity
Danielle love,"Mark looks intelligent , classy and handsome i refuse to believe he is a robot he is just well mannered a proper  ü§£ pricilla is a lucky gal for sure"

I am watching the Foundation with the company of a good bottle of wine.. it‚Äôs almost over.. I have listened to your nice interview with Mark. He seems ok. I think he sees the future, and I think overall his meta move is a brilliant move!! But Lex you have to convince him. We need a ‚Äúscratch‚Äù in the new meta world. Suddenly in my mind all the big nature moments passed through my mind: an earthquake, a windy night, raindrops on your face, a snowstorm, a hot summer, a super moon, swimming in the ocean at night‚Ä¶ we need those, we need the physical experiences‚Ä¶ I live in a small Greek town and do not have be the power‚Ä¶ but please. Please convince him to make some room for real physical experiences with nature and other human beings‚Ä¶"
Christen Denise,"Wow wow wow, amazing Lex. You are such an amazing, compassionate person. In the first half hour or so, I thought,  can Mark ever relax and not always be doing an animated business presentation? Towards the end, you brought out his human side, and that was noticeable by the relaxing of his hand gestures. You are well on your way to millions of subscribers; you deserve it."
Lupf,"M.Z. ""Why wouldn't I spend almost as much money on my appearance or expression for my photorealistic avatar for meetings as for whatever I'm gonna wear in my video chat?""

Because I'm fully aware that ""producing"" virtual items costs nothing and simply refuse to pay a similar amount, just for the ""manufacturers"" profit? Because I don't wear clothes for the sole purpose of impressing someone in a meeting? Because I'd need real clothes anyway to keep me warm, comfortable and well dressed in the real world and don't want to double-spend? Dude ..."
PROGROCK?MORELIKEFROGC0CK,Im so grateful for these conversations. Lex has ridden me of my cynicism and I think he will change the world

Jason X,"This is a whole other side to Mark I've never seen before, thank you for this podcast it really shows him in a different light."
Tahjo,"You know, I don't think Mark is a bad person. But I feel like he has a lot of cognitive dissonance going on."
Mick,Love your intro.
Oopsmark Mtl,"wow, i was excited to see Marc talk, but i felt like this was more of a scripted commercial than a podcast. Not a conversation about issues.  Marc's responses are so much smarter than the questions, it's clear that he chose this channel so appear on. Sorry but i'm calling #sellout on this ""podcast episode"""
fez khanna,I have been waiting for this episode
Bushido VR,Props to Mark for this conversation. This is probably the most natural and relatable I've ever seen him come across  in all the media he's done so far.
Larry Henderson,I would‚Äôve rather seen this interview go more into the personal life of Mark Zuckerberg this interview had more of a infomercial feel to it selling meta-verse. I‚Äôm sorry but this is just my opinion I would like to know more about just who Mark Zuckerberg really is and how he grew up and things he enjoys to do

Hell_Pike,Just the way he talks is so robotic and like strange and funny. He legit scares me like I really feel like he may be a sentient AI
Matt Waters,"Havent seen the vid yet, does he mention he took the name and concept from the fiction book Snow Crash? It explains exactly the kind of dystopian image he has in mind for tge meta verse. In case anyone is interested."

GameNationRDF,Stellar work Lex. This is the best interview of Mark that I have ever seen/heard. You are great at what you do
Michael Poole,"Mark doesn't answer the hard questions that would suggest any possibility of negative uses of the technology. He either distracts, without answering the question at all, or he briefly addresses it before distracting you with another up-side of the technology. Basically, he's hiding something. I think he's hiding how addictive he thinks the technology is as well as all of the bad use-cases that are certainly going to evolve. Stay on alert when listening to this guy speak."

morn1415,"I lived for some time already, played PacMan at the arcade. Always have been fascinated with technology. Recently obsessed with VR. In VrChat I saw very young people who live and socialize there because their parents don¬¥t care, I saw a Treehouse that's a work of art with the creator already passed away, I met a Dragon who did not speak living in an awesome Landscape that somebody else built, giving me a ride to the next mountaintop. I met a girl who said she lives by creating Avatars for people. When I asked how people would find her service she said she put a poster with her Mail next to the Virtual Bar. "
Christian Francia,"I feel that @52:26 it speaks more to the US discourse: Being load and talking over one another and who ever is the loudest is ""correct"". Other countries don't support or give way to this type of rhetoric."

Nicki,Omg such a dork lol I love how this started
Emmanuel Oluga,59:00 is comedy gold
Alice Brooks,Have you all heard about META VERSUS? MetaVersus: Introducing the better metaverse.
SkillGame,"This was a fascinating conversation, great to hear Mark in a long-form setting where he's not relentlessly being grilled by antagonistic lawmakers. Without really thinking about it, I've been guilty of seeing him solely through the lens of memes and/or as an example of the dark side of tech and capitalism. "
MetaSamsara,"In France most people hate fb for cutting us from real life interactions being the main driver of social dynamics. I do believe the metaverse has a place in there, and at a larger scale the Internet. But decentralization will be necessary for digital identity and human rights in the digital. That doesn't mean there is no room for centralized servers indeed, but not when it comes to social media. This will be decentralized. No one trusts Mark anymore, no matter if he changed his narrative."
Doug Medina,"Who would you rather smoke a joint with Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg?  Neither, Joe Rogan is the answer, but this is an interesting interview and I enjoy my Oculus 2 VR goggles."

Adnan Khan,I wonder how hot Zuckerberg's CPU got when processing the AI responses to Lex's questions.
Ray Rivera,1:27:40 Lex should have pressed Mark on this question. Why does Facebook censor well known published experts?
That'sjustnotfair,"I believe Zuck. Aferall, he was human once. He said so, himself."

Terrie Coleman,"Cinticism is in the heart of every human being. Some just call it selfishness, but we base every decision that we make upon what we want to do, because in the end, it‚Äôs our decisions to make, so we make it based upon our own wants and beliefs.

1celtickiwi,"The Metaverse is a perfect idea for an over populated world, go live on the Moon or Mars without fear of pollution?"
mercster,"I think the question about the appropriateness or differences of avatars is interesting.  The way I thought about it is: in the real world, sure, you can show up to a business meeting for job interview in a clown or pirate outfit, but you're limiting your chances of success.  We will always need, and have, community standards.  People who think the metaverse will be some free-for-all where they can be whatever they want, at all times... might be barking up the wrong tree."
Bob Britches,Seems I didn't see or talk to folks as much when FB got big though still communicated with them through FB.  Then everyone started asking me to fertilize their crops and other dumb things.  I quit FB and haven't talked to much of anyone since.

Jose Virella Velazquez,I was with my baby when I heard that intro and started to sob unexpectedly üòÜ Lex really gets to me. I‚Äôm so happy he exists.
mac336,Mark river danced around the first social dilemma question
Chris Castillo,I respect Zucks because his product has helped me support my family and getting out of the 9 to 5 rat race. I reach alot of people in my local area. Thats my personal experience.
Mary Halverson,Billionaires with too much time on their useless hands are the bane of human existence.
tLua,"So, it seems to me that mr. Zuckerberg likes to overestimate how much enjoyment people derive from VR. Either that, or he underestimates the dependence of all economy (and human existence, in all honesty) on actual labor. Isn't it so easy to get lost in the idea that you are creating a new word, where the only rules are those made up by you (as if you were God himself)?"
Felix The Cat,I thought this was fake. Crazy how you got him on here. Lex just surpassed joe lol
doug c,"Lex sure does get a lot of intriguing guests and handles them beautifully. May he continue in the style of interviews that he is currently conducting and maintaining being the man of his convictions that his monologue implies. Personally, he may be THE MAN to follow. Keep up the good work. Integrity is a priceless characteristic. The world needs it!"
Stars N Stripes,"Lex, you are a Force of nature."
happyfella,"The biggest take away I got from this is that social media is a manipulated version of reality. This is from the aspect of the user and the company. For specific use cases, maybe no harm but having a dependency on this technology is dangerous for all generations of people."
Howard K,"What happened to the hard questions? Zuckerberg is super skilled at evasion. Doesn‚Äôt he make the average politician look like a mute button?

Forbesartworks,That was very open interview he look normal actually
Matt Waters,"30:20 So metaverse is supposed to be the new economy. And to even participate you need to get biometrically scanned. And digital clothes will be as expensive as high end designer clothing. And land will be as expensive as the real world. And, as the book Snow Crash indicates (where the name metaverse was copied from) the only area anyone spends time in will be loaded with huge advertisements.... 1/4 of the interview so far..."
Diji,14:52 I always put the speakers window right below my webcam so that when I'm speaking to them It looks as though I'm making eye contact. Someone needs to automate this! $$$
Claire M,"Great interview. For me personally, the takeaway is not to judge someone based on a congressional hearing."
ZNAKE,1:23:59 No Mark not everyone draws a line with an inalieable right.
Ethan Satcher,I feel like I can almost hear him try not to say how meta is about controlling how people can interact‚Ä¶..
ryan davies,How tf Lex even get these people so weird he's real life ash catchem with his pod cast fr
Andre Johansen,Talking to Zuck is like talking to a Wal . Always a study that say oh no it's the opposite. If it's not? Then we pay for one ü§ë

Michi Ackermans,"I love that I'm close to tears in the intro and dying of laughter 2 seconds into the interview. Thank you doesn't do my gratitude justice, you're inspiring millions with your work here Lex."
A,Why don't people like Mark Z? ... I think it's because you never see him openly talk. He always seems in the shadows hiding which makes people suspicious...this was a great interview though and he should do more things like this.
Bill A,Zuck really needed to do an interview like this. One doesn't achieve what he has done without some level of genius.its refreshing to see Marks actual thoughts and feelings in this conversation for us to judge for ourselves. Well done with this interview Lex!

Greg Lippmann,People will always be more interested in the real world than in a digitial appearance. Anyone who pays more attention to his/her digital appearance is likely to be depressed and miserable.
Mark O,"Mr Friedman, I heard you say ‚ÄúMost people are good‚Äù  and must argue with you now for the sake of God and Mankind.   When you imagine what good is defined in order to categorize individuals or groups, what standards are you using?   Are they written down somewhere?  If they are please share them with the world.  I know for certain I have been terribly violated by people that not only thought they are good, but also great.   We need a mandatory worldwide curriculum from K-12, and then ethics training for adults after that unto the grave!   Would you agree?  The crook fraud President Joe Biden stated on TV that 10-15 percent of people aren‚Äôt good.  I wonder what standard he judges with.  If he uses the Catholic parameters, I doubt Islam would align with him entirely seeing that behavior which Biden champions as a crook himself.   That ethics training for adults wasn‚Äôt available for him either.  End: Lesson 1"
Noctuboi,"Lex, as always, you where brilliant. Not giving your guest a special treatment for who they are, asking the difficult questions and remaining true and on top of the conversation. You could clearly see that Mark was having fun and being himself, a version of him I don't think I had seen before and that I really enjoyed. Thank you!"
Robinette,feel like the more awkward questions were perhaps conveniently avoided
Bj,"Totally wrong. My friends in college were all into drugs. They were just fun, so I hung out with them. Now I work at an international law firm. So friends don't mean shit, unless you're a robot maybe ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

2thinkon,Your research on teen mental health was done so you can sit there and have an argument against the critics who've accurately pointed out that you seek to psychologically trap teens into using your product. You created the research just to further manipulate people.

n017kingg,"Zuckerberg after this video I like you, Facebook for the win and security good"
DA S,"no one has ever answered the why

why does anyone need metaverse or vr"
Digital Halos,"The idea Mark touched on that the group of people that were polarized after the 2016 election, weren't even on the internet; is probably more due to the cancel culture and banning of many conservatives, stoking fear and reticence to engage or post on FB as well as churn off of FB to more free-speech advocating social media platforms.  I don't know how much of this is because of alleged collusion between the  corporate big tech establishment and the political left & ruling party establishment; versus how much is from employees and corporate culture at FB and other big tech orgs being indoctrinated and living in the left main stream corporate information operations feedback loop, and not interested in thinking individually and seeking greater nonpartisan truths of the world.  (How many got banned and censored for both lab-leak theory or Hunter's laptop? And how many disengaged and didn't bother posting due to fear of cancel culture or banning, or left the platform for other platforms more conscious of the US constitution and bill of rights,  and that believe in freedom of speech and expression!!)"

Linda Kay,"I think Mark should send all his FB Users a PAYCHECK each month! A % CUT of the HUGE advertising revenues he receives for OUR engagement! He gets filthy rich off OUR eyeballs and clickthrus on all the ads he sells - using OUR DATA that he mines & gathers for FREE and sells to advertisers. So - The more you engage, the bigger your monthly paycheck should be! Share the Wealth Marky - Pay your work mules! Because without US, FB Users, he earns ZERO! üßê"
kurt. is,Yo my man.. first the captcha had me weak as hell lol. But you ask some great questions I wish I would think of actually asking‚Ä¶ unless this is all a simulation as well then I.. I should just shut up and watch the video now.
Tasty Toast,I wish this was four hours long. Brilliant work Lex and hearing from Mark has been amazing.
Michael DiMattia,"Lex's expression when Mark mentions WhatsApp and talks about security 38:40 ish... anyone else see the issue here with WhatsApp?  Am I just uninformed, or over-informed?  Sounds like Mark is saying your information is always at risk and it will always be your fault.  Weird rant he does there."
vuul‚öõÔ∏è,"Wow I fiend for these high intellectual conversations, the intro was extremely deep and emotional and I thank you Lex"
mili is my name,One of best interviews with Zuck I've ever seen!!!! Good luck with Meta!
Anondroid,"Did anyone else notice that he got real tense when talking about decentralization and had NO good reason to stay centralized. Of course he is against decentralization, if he doesn't own your data he can't sell it. Listening to him just confirms my dislike of him and his company's practices. Platforms built on decentralized tech like Cardano are going to replace this evil centralized identity stealing  corp stuff."

This is going to be a mess people will no go out and meet in person, then imagine the wireless telephone was great because people actually went out and that‚Äôs why it was great‚Ä¶ then the internet and so on‚Ä¶ so why worry when all this new inventions will only serve us to live a more flexible life just like you are watching this interview with a billionarie on the comfort of your home or car or plane‚Ä¶ this is the real life we will never be plugged in 24/7 and if you are that only means you have a unhealthy relationship with technology. Think of all the opportunities and take advantage this our age"

Matt Waters,"28:50 Why wouldnt you pay as much for digital clothes as real clothes? Idk, maybe cause real clothes require resources and production costs. Digital clothes can be outsourced to AI based on users filling out style preference forms. Thats why."
Ottavio Scotto di Luzio,Well One thing is for sure.. Mark thinks a lot for being a robot
Gabe J,This guy is programmed to make himself look good. End of story.
Not Gunna Do It,"Here's the disingenuous part. Mark pretends that he knew he was building a company that was going to be as successful as FB has become. Here's reality, there is so much luck involved. He pretends that this key component doesn't exist or he was just so spot on he didn't need the luck component. Reality is like is a massive portion of the pie chart on how to build a successful company. Every smart person knows this as a fact."

That's exactly what a Robot person pretending to be a human would say."
Pall Mall,"Yeah... Social media is in all parts of the world, but the only difference is their CONTROL algorithms aren't as effective for every other language like it is for English.  Could this imply that the imposition of CONTROL on a group of people is what leads to polarization??  I think there is a good argument for that."
Ruben L,"""we're building a product"". Yes, yes you are! except the product is society, meta and FB are just the building blocks."
Abel Chipepe,That is what I thought. People think that it is easy like a black and white thing. There some many gray areas and too many people yelling. What would you do confronted with the possibility of letting your baby die and trying to mediate among thousand of dummy people thinking that they are right and have the supreme truth?
Booji Boy,"Lex, you let him off the hook, WHY?! Mark said he allocated judgement on free speech to Globalists. We‚Äôre Americans, we don‚Äôt like being censored by people with Marxist values. You had your chance and let you let him go on a diatribe of Globalism. You let him off the hook with just bringing it up and then you went onto another subject, WHY?"
Theodore Castro,5:37 LOL that was historic
Daves Reality,First time ive really watched him in a normal setting he seems alright . Cant believe how far the channel has come ! Being an OG sub its great to see you thriving and getting these great guests ! I await Putins interview ! i really really hope you can get him on !
Jonatan,"Not fully understanding the praise for Zuckerberg in the comments, I fail to see how this interview portrays him in any new light. He is just answering the questions in the same lecturing, media trained, robotic and avoidant way as always. Zuckerberg talks the talk of the future but he is not operating from the heart, he is still in the old mind-based paradigm, building products that are messy and unaligned."
Martin Duran,I wonder if they have solid barbers in the metaverse

Booz,"Mark you‚Äôre an inspiration, but please stop supporting democrats, it‚Äôs an unhealthy addiction.

Luke W.,The Turing test was passed A++
Clayton Knapp,"great interview.  definitely humanized him.  i think he seems like a genuinely good and nice person.  

he has done a lot to advance the human race and we should maybe thank him rather than demonize him."
keyan gaming,"I dont know what to think about the metaverse. I mean it is the next thing, right? But like so many people are talking about it and when in history was something new so popular already. It is not even there yet. The internet, who talked about it when it first came around and now, look around, everybody is being in there. idk what to think about this"

Mark Rodriguez,When your stock drops so you gotta go major PR
Don Blackburn,Doctor Noonian Soong made many of these AIs. The one not in a suit will eventually get his emotion chip.
Righthandman,My approach to this character (MZ) is that he is smart and not to be trusted AT ALL. It also seem m he likes the sound of his own voice.
iLL eAgLE,"Ah ... so nice to hear people rationally, respectfully talking and listening to each without interrupting one another. We humans are so capable; just a shame we can't make this style of communication infectious ... or can we?"
Etheric Bliss,"How do we even know that these ""interviews"" are not ""manufactured""??? We NEVER see you both together, even a third camera that shows BOTH of you, at the same time. It's always simple ""cuts"" from one to the other. The interviewee COULD, seriously be across this ""Realm"" and you simply SPLICE them together. I've also noticed that nobody even touches their microphone. This cat could have been recorded over ""video conference"" as you talk about whilst recording the person, in another time/place and simple ""plop"" and/or green screen them in."
Bob Johnson,"The thing about social media is people are going to fight and disagree, only it's public. It makes the micro macro. We can't get in a situation where things that are upsetting is censored or certain political ideas. If you had any internet platform where people could post anything people would end up posting things and arguing.. it's more the human condition running through social media than social media creating this situation. My only qualm would be biased censorship."
Glendarelli,"Zuckerberg resembles a cousin of ""Doug Heffernan"" form King of Queens."
Hacked Reality,"Lex, is his the first half-alien, half-robot that you've interviewed? Alien robots like that thing you interviewed shouldn't use words like ""I care"" because it's kind does not comprehend the meaning of those words."
V&V Chronicles,Just for the record... I'll take Mother Nature any day...
Thermal Media,This might break the internet. Props to Lex for doing this interview and bringing it to the world.

Dragon Legend,My mom is such a huge Oloff fan that she got the lyrics to 'Doing It Stealthy' tattooed across her breasts.
Chris Eckeard,"I'm glad you had him on though I dislike him and his company evens more now. You can hear him say it repeatedly. ""I think...we all believe it should be this way...so that's why we do what we do."""
Mick,"I don't think scientists have the responsibility to constantly engage with people that are not willing to change their mind. By the time a scientist publishes a single article that follows the necessesary guidelines etc., hundreds of others could have written a blog post/article that do not. The difference is that the latter don't adhere to these guidelines and simply want to speak their mind. This is part of free speech and is totally fine, but partially due to this I question if it is wise to make censorship a collective effort."
Mo AKM,"As far as I can tell, robots are ment to be super booring, but these ones ain't booring"
Josh Edenfield,"Lex you're a legend, looking forward to what you will do in the future beyond this. The world is a better place with you in it doing what you do"

Kevin Bergman,Mark is one of the few people who make me uncomfortable. And I'm still happy for Lex for this interview.
nonono,"Am I the only one who thinks that I am not gonna wear some AR/AI glasses? I wanna see world as it is. If I wanna meet family and friends I meet them. Yea when it starts to be a better way to call why not. But then I take it off and come back to reality. And gaming of course. But I am sure it will cause a lot of social damage, like people who got sucked in in those virtual worlds- because their real world sucked. IMO even apple watch is too far, why tf I need all the time my watch to inform me about some stupid shit. I understand that it is great business because they will collect even more data and can show you realistic ads. But for humanity, at least in mental, wellbeing, health aspects- it's a step in wrong direction."
Cheryl Cold,"Many enthusiastic comments are directed towards the humanity recently updated in the MZ os. Personally I still think there's a lot of room for improvement. It needs to spend more time in a family/human environment. Possibly install some slang words, and work on the colour of the skin to remove the over-powering green tint."
Schmeckleberry,24:41 give it up to whoever the fuck needed to take a picture with the flash on üòÇ
harsh bharti,"Virtual or not, the question of Avatars is basically reddit(anonymity) vs twitter or something. Take away the mask and people will make their own. Give them one & people will remove theirs."
John Peluso,Social Media is road rage. Real easy to talk shit without the risk of getting decked.
James Conroy,"He's humanised himself in the eyes of many, including me. Great interview. Easily Mark's best. 

I literally ask my daughters that very same question most days at dinner. And the answer to the last question blew me away."
DragonNF,"he literally dodged all the tough questions about censorship by going on  about old thoughts of how facebook started and believed in freedom of speech, but never gets to why he decides to censor a certain side more often for the exact same rhetoric"
S D,"58:00 You know why people judge it that harshly? Because for people, you have a Godlike AI that controls all of these Content Moderation decisions when in reality it is a bunch of call centers in Phillipines who don't even speak the language. The moment you and all SM giants start paying serious attention to content moderation as a serious and well paid professions, then you'll be able to regain at least some of that trust. Current model is based on obscurity, which is a known recipe for disaster in the technological space. Wake TF up Mark!"

Peter Delgado,"Lex, this is another great conversation. Even though you did ask a few confrontational questions, you're way of delivering them was very well done. It didn't come across as a way to tear him down, rather, it came a cross as a human to human dialogue. I do believe Mark is mostly well intended and misunderstood. I don't know how I would approach these situations if I were in his shoes. I like him a bit more now."
David Plumer,He acts like he's damned if he does or doesn't censor but he could easily choose to have a no censorship policy along with educating people how to use the block button. That's what causes the anger Zuck. You take away choice.
William Borrows,"Just a few years ago, we had fun forcing conversations between a siri and an Alexa. Today we have sophisticated conversations like these. Very convincing."
"Hamzah Saman, CSA",Beautiful words
MAC,"Avatars in the workplace is a ridiculous concept. We already have face to face video in real time. Someone needing an avatar to connect, probably means they don't like their true self. I'm probably way off base but, just some thoughts lol... At least he admits that our country is polarized. Now, the question is, how can we have differences and still be on the same team! #merica"
Prismo,Dude has a fetish with being a dragon üòÜ
Justin Potts,Never forget this dude was trained by the WEF to be a fucking sith
Zeitgeist_Gaming,His responses are extremely robotic like holy crap.
Piero Vergara,"I was expecting an A tier chatbot feedback loop lol but Mark seems very genuine tbh - esp when he's addressing things that are more ""I"" than ""we at meta"" - his thinking face seems authentic - like he truly gave it a real ponder. "
kevin devaney,Zuk says free speech is his thing.....yet sensor's speech all across his platforms!
Tony Hull,I think Zuckerburg genuinely lacks an intrinsic understanding of human nature.
Vindaloo,"There are 17,000+ comments on here when I write this, so I doubt anyone will see it and react to it, especially Mark himself : But this is what I got out of this interview...

Mark Z really believes in this stuff and I feel like his path and passion got twisted along the way of his success, marriage and modern politics. At the same time, although he is innocent in some ways, he doesn't understand the real world and what is going on between average people on daily basis. If he really wanted to make a better world, he should really step down as CEO and start something new on his own. Cause this Meta/Fbook sh* is way too toxic and unhelpful for the society as a whole, at least not anymore."
lyagushka,"I like Lex, but holy shit he glows from orbit."
jonathan Stafford,I guess my only question is how long until we are a helmet species like from stargate
Simon Maswabi,Let's be honest the longest zuck interview. Really really enjoyed this! stuck on my couch the whole podcast:):) Thank You Lex

Edgar Arturo,This intro got me eyes watering
Hamed Adefuwa,"Proud of you Lex, this one was amazing. I don't particularly like Zuck but you did super well bringing up hard topics but at the same time, you honoured him and didn't disrespect him. I rate that highly."
Rishi Sharraf,Meta is Evil. Mark my word
The Social Exchange Podcast,"I rarely watch introductions of any podcast‚Äî yours today was phenomenal. 

As was the entire interview."
OLORUN MUSIC,"This moment sums up it up- 58:47 Lex: ""How does it feel as a human being that most people have a negative view of you as a leader?"" Mark: ""Er Uh... well it's not great."" aka ""I can only process binary outcomes, like great or not great. I am a psychopath. I don't feel. If 25% or 75% or 100% of people don't like me that's just A-ok üôÇ!!"" Lex didn't ask him what he ""thought,"" he asked him how does it ""feel"" mutha-()%&#@!!! Exactly! He doesn't feel!  Lex keeps asking Mark to ""Steel man"" these arguments (A steel man argument (or steelmanning) is the opposite of a straw man argument. The idea is to help one's opponent to construct the strongest form of their argument. Ok so Mark is a Tin man. He doesn't feel anything....just like the Tin Man portrayed by Nipsey Russell or Ne-Yo in ""The Wiz"" (1978)... "
Tistou Blomberg,Thanks Mark for doing this! I'm happy you could do this and for 2 hours! Thanks Lex for making it possible.
Michael Wicker,"""I don't think anyone expected this to be going on for years""... Said everyone that understands the keys of power and how dangerous it feels to those in power to let it go ever.

Cesar was given temporary power and was succeeded years after his term limit, he was succeeded by a new emperor who took more power then Cesar did."
Richard Ipsen,I think Mark punked you into answering the question you asked him about misinformation...

Scott Storm Carter,"I am confused by things on Facebook, but hate definitely does not apply."
Anthony myers,"Can I just say that captcha code joke in the beginning had me dying after the serious introduction. I've been looking forward to this. Thank you. Wish I could say thank you to Mark, but he banned me on Facebook for 24 hours last week for no reason.üòÇ But seriously. Thank you."

Jo Ris,"Damn, Fb / Meta has to be in a pretty bad spot for Mark to show up in this kind of interview"

2judge1,"Wow lex, well done for getting Mark in for an interview, bet you were jumping up and down when he agreed to do this because I don't think he has ever done a podcast before."
zagyex,Shallow answers to deep questions. No judgement tho.
Ramin Rahnema,Mark seems buff as fuck underneath it all
Olanrewaju OLUWOLE,1:43:00 Hire people who you would also consider working for
EdoHDpro,"I try almost try as hard as he tries, to like him for a single contribution to society, but cant name one,  while he is trying so hard hard to be liked, like the annoying kid at school no one liked, his goal is not responsibility, his goal is to turn virtuality into reality, just like turning lie into truth, a master of deception"
Adam J,Wow 2hrs time to strap myself in for this ride
O. M. Kaya - Ozturk,"Great interview. I saw Mark from a different angle. 

He's clearly more empathatic than I thought. He's also articulate and a deep thinker."
1celtickiwi,"There is alot of sci-fi movies that reflect Zuckers future for his girls. Is there to many peolpe? Respect Rex, love you bro"
Thoughtcriminal,"The ""Am I a Robot"" test was hilarious, Lex! Well done! Thank you so much for the amazing interviews and variety of topics. You are awesome, much love! ü§ç"
Greg French,Nice base tan Mark! LOOKING REALLY HUMAN! ü§£ü§£
Erik A,"This was a bit of a nothing-burger. It feels like every answer is targeted towards shareholders. He dodges and turns around questions and in the end it all just sounds like a promotion of his company. Just a lot of super safe responses. Unlike Elon Musk who is very much a flawed human like the rest us and thus just a lot more likeable and fun to listen to. Enjoyed it though, he is still an interesting person. Could do a second round."
Kyle Rose,"I was just thinking, what's the sound of two robots clapping each other's cheeks? üëè"
Christopher Chang,Zuck must have spent lots of time with Peter T...his speech and body language mannerisms are almost exactly the same.

Sherif Ehab,"I think this is the first time I get to see the ""real"" ""nerd"" mark that's just like every other passionate programmer ready to talk about what he loves for hours given the chance, even though it's mostly advertisement for metaverse, I appreciate you showing us this side of him Lex :)"
TheTopAwesome,Zucc keeps using race and political relations as a reason for being disliked. Lex didn't tackle at the real questions. Should've asked him why he micro-analyzes humans.
SmackyMc Productions,"The way to combat misinformation is by facilitating debate, not by censoring information that conflicts with the centralized narrative.  See scientific method"

Universal creator,"Has somebody asked. Why? Why do we need to create metaverse. Yeah things are fun. But what is the cost. There is always a cost. Can we at least have a global conversation to see if the cost is worth it.. It is probably not going to be stopped, but then at least we are more understanding to keep the cost to a minimum."
Kelly Barnes,"Wow, Lex, you are amazing - you managed to get the human out of Zuck. I wasn‚Äôt even going to watch this but glad I did. He should thank you üòâ"
ChaosTherum,"Nobody is arguing about the definition of hate speech, the free speech side of the argument fully accepts hate speech is a thing, we just also say sadly it is still free speech and must be allowed, without hate speech there is no free speech."
Mathieu Beaulieu,"Lex please explain us the meaning of the 70's macrame dish rack behind Mark ? Is there a connection with the lighting? Because he is too pale, you cannot put only the usual black curtain?"
randobad,"He builds products that make him money, people get angry using this product, he gave them what they want, people want to fight. People are stupid."
Johno Johnson,The Zuck has the look of a digital projection in real life. That‚Äôs why he is so desperate to get into the meta world as he like look normal in there
Real Pc Benchmark,"There is something about this fella that say to me ""don't trust him'"
Paul Fidika,"The problem with Facebook is that it changed from being a platform on which people express ideas, to a moderator of those ideas. Moderating ""misinformation"" and ""hate speech"" is an impossible task, and Facebook shouldn't pretend that it can. Now rather than getting mad at Trump for saying something mean on Facebook, the public gets mad at Facebook for not censoring him. Rather than criticizing Joe Rogan for covid misinformation, the public gets mad at Spotify for not censoring him. Platforms should allow for the expression of ideas, not put their own judgements on top of them."
Nicholas,I don't agree with Mark's stance that 'everybody agrees there is a line with speech'. I don't think any one person or one company is able to decide what that line is and therefore we can not have any such line. I make the argument that what is more dangerous than speech is dogma - perspectives that are taken as faith and go unquestioned.
social experimentalist,Lex - your intros are gold and your humility shines through. I am however surprised that the comments section is not very challenging of this interview. Whilst you did ask him some tricky questions you let him off the hook in my opinion although I realise you weren't trying to hook him. He needs to be grilled on the fact that FB has tricked people out of their data which they  OWN. And you should have pushed him on the so called fact checkers. Furthermore on his company being in bed with big pharma and corrupt governments

David Becker,The most humanizing thing I've ever seen mark do. This is a pr triumph for him and quite the media coup for you lex. Thanks to you both for an interesting conversation!
,This is the first time I saw Mark open up in a more human way and it was really cool to see. I hope he does more interviews/podcasts like this.

Carlo Luna,I think we are living in a Metaverse...
jerrrrr,"1:27:51 to 1:31:51 Mark Zuckerberg's face seems like wasn't ready for that answer. (Reflecting on the whole conversation) I don't know, call me jaded/biased/closed-minded... Mark Zuckerberg is a CEO of a for-profit company. A for-profit company's goal is to make money. As the CEO, he is focused on saying whatever makes the most money for his company... whether that takes into consideration longevity (and the future of humanity) or not, I don't know. But many CEO's (and company's) have chosen profits over the well-fare of people in the past. What a world we live in."

Jarrett,On the ‚Äúadvice for young people‚Äù when Mark shared about his relationship with his daughters and wife - that was good stuff he shared. People focused. Giving focused.

519MaLoNeY,"This is outstanding. Mark is NOWHERE near as weird as I thought he was going off of the various short clips and talks I‚Äôve seen with him. 
I hope he learns that a natural and not forced or scripted approach to interacting with people is the way to go."
RinpocheMinds,"Lex, thank you for the insightful interviews you give.  The only thing I noticed missing from the censorship topic was that preeminent science experts are also censored.  That is a crucial point of distinction."
big fish,"Lex, you're opening speech, or intro, was great!     The traffic light test was a brilliant idea. Unfortunately, a robot as advanced and sophisticated as Mark Zuckerberg can easily fool that test."
Andrew McLean,This will age well
Trey Madden,It‚Äôs awesome how crazy life is. Look at the people you are interviewing now bro. Congratulations and I wish you success!
Big Pappa Musk,"The metaverse is just going to create even more hunchback chunky weirdos, so wack."
Taylor Evers,"We have to keep in mind that the solution for ""keeping people from impersonating you"" is a double edged sword and, while necessary in some cases, should be used with caution. Having to legally verify your identity can of course provide the benefit of accountability in online forums, offer you additional services tailored to you, and protect your identity, but it also opens up a mass of data to be tied to you legally that the providing organization can do with as they please. This is a problem especially for those who live in a place where the government has absolute control over the companies within it, their data, and the law of the land. "
Extremely Broad,"Lex, I am through episode 1 of your conversation with Mark Zuckerberg. It is crazy to think of what ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù started as and where it is now. 
You both covered such important facets of human communication and behaviour that are present with or without social media. There has always been some form of ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù in all cultures throughout time. A huge difference is now it is measurable the human response on a micro level to what is injested and spewed out. I myself will swing to the bright side of things and hope that as AI and the open communication in social networking progresses it will bring down more social barriers than people or the media would have us believe it creates."
Demethans Keep,Really opened my eyes to this side of Mark Zuckerberg.  Thanks Lex for your great work.
Peter San Miguel,"Hey Mark, thanks for Biden."

Eliezer Bautista,I still dont believe he went to the podcast
Hecmar Jayam,That was a damn good interview Lex. Possibly among your best. It is a fair and honest view of Mark. Thank you.

Cody wilkinson,Thank you for everything you do with this podcast Lex. Your a true King of our time

What does Zuckerberg think about how the physical world will look like as the virtual world becomes more prevalent?"
StarChild,"Windows 11 still not as important for his Company, so a widows 11 patch absence has rendered most of our Expenditure worthless, which is stealing that money!"
Gil Monteverde,Damn I never saw Mark so relaxed. Very enjoyable conversation actually!!!
OnigoroshiZero,"This was really interesting, and Lex again was making some hard questions.

edit: The one thing I am certain after watching this, is that Mark really likes his dragons. Maybe I should invite him to a D&D campaign..."
Thomas Conger,What a perfect person to interview Mark Zuckerberg. Starting off with that Captcha joke for him was the funniest shit I've witnessed in years. It doesn't get funnier than that.
Pika So,Message to devs - Is it the real Mark we saw here?

Jordan Martineau,You are an amazing person and I would really like to see you in person and shake your hand.  May life bring you cooperation and voice to your interests and your intent to make it the best thing for yourself and the people who want to do something to help the world.   God bless you brother!
Johnny Philipps,1st off let me just say that your opening dialogue  is absolutely g**** beautiful ....
Wanna Bus?,"I used to wonder if lex was controlled opposition since he just appeared out of nowhere, his dad is in ‚Äúthe system‚Äù and he is eloquent. No longer do I wonder, lex is clearly a co-opted forum for them, no different than cnn or fox. Sucker berg would never go on a show where his feet are actually put to the fire."

Rutuja Darode,Amazing podcast. It was very insightful on listening to such diverse insights from Mark.  Thanks a lot lex for asking such diverse set of questions
ThoughtWave64,That was good...I fear MZ less than when I started watching this.
Lasty first,I‚Äôll join meta when they can get vr stank on my vr hang low
erikals,Zuckerberg actually delivered a very good talk here.
Vance,after watching this im sure hes an ET
Rob,Fascinating. I've seen so many segments of Mark responding to difficult questions and accusations where he sounds like he's being evasive and weird but here he's in his element and is still being equally awkward lol I actually warmed up to him a lot in this interview. Great insight into a person I never knew but had many preconceptions and opinions about.
filthysock,"Holy shit; that opening introduction is the best reflection on the world today, that I have heard. If you were to look back onto 2022 to understand anything about the current state of affairs, this is it. He worded it perfectly. It hits even harder to know that he has family ties to Russia and Ukraine himself. This is historic."
Daniel Cogzell,"This was actually one of my favourite interviews. Really impressed with Mark but at the same time just think I was silly to doubt him in the first place. Very smart man, tackling very difficult questions. This interview changed my perspective for the better. Thanks Lex for conducting. :)"
Anthony Shereda,"FUCKING BEST INTRO QUESTION EVER ASKED EVER. please for the love of god just clip that, so i can share it everywhere LOL"
viiii,I enjoyed these two robots interacting together very much.
Dallas Beaufort,"His original page layout is brilliant, alas his now processes corrupt free speech which was the platforms reason and logic, cash grab, yes. He's lost his way."
Dalida Dalida,"Very interesting interview, thank you Lex. And thanks for asking the tough questions a lot of us would have wanted to ask. He was clearly uncomfortable when you pressed him on sensitive and important subjects. He certainly is a good and smooth communicator, I have to give him that. Your face throughout the interview was reflecting distrust but scepticism at best (at least that is how I interpreted it) which was interesting to see. EDIT: Also, you seemed to become slightly impatient with MZ when he struggled to answer the final big ridiculous question, and you commented ""sounds like an argument your daughters would make."" I've never seen you talk tougher with anyone. And look at MZ's last facial expressions! EDIT This was an excellent interview! Thank you and I am looking forward to your interview with Putin, I hope you will be able to talk with him. xx"
Josue Leon,Great conversation!
Jade Freeman,wow. so many incredible guest speakers on this channel it's hard to comprehend :)
ThaGhost44,Sounds like unauthentic AI bots having a conversation
Sam West,"Good work, Lex.
Well, I finished it, and all I can say is that Mark Zuckerberg didn't do himself any favors here. There were just too many instances where he spoke, uninterrupted, for minutes at a time, and said nothing... very slippery."
Lazy SKB,To actually state instagram is healthy for teens with a straight face...
DRideeeN,Your interviews are a service to humanity. Keep up the good work!
Janac Meena,Interesting how lex switches gears when mark asks 'what would you do?'
Matt Neagle,"Far and away most interesting part of this interview was when he asked Lex what he would do and Lex explained giving more transparency to let people understand the complexity of what your decision making entails and why and let the people decide what to do with that. 
Be less robotic and distant and more human because people will react and respond to that. Get out of your own head. Brilliant."
Diwakar,I think Mark should be open to doing more of these kind of podcasts and interviews on forums where he's allowed to freely express himself. Positive vibes.
Danny Mayday,"I regret that I only have one dislike to give. Question for Mark:  ""Do you know ANYONE that feels better for using your 'products'?"""
Pieter Claus,"Lex you went way to easy on him, really, he skillfully ovoided answering the harder questions, and there weren't many. Disappointing interview"
Rich,Mark should do more of these. I understand him and his business decisions better after listening. I like watching how meticulously he frames his answers.
Matthew O‚ÄôRiordan,I don‚Äôt understand what the meta verse is and I‚Äôm not sure this interview is gonna explain it
Bartek Cioru≈Ñ,"Just after watching the introduction, all I can say is- Lex, I love you. You are the impersonation of my faith in humanity."
Kevin Merendino,Where I see meta really taking off is productivity. Imagine sitting down to Excell for the first time with a personal A.I. tutor.
AffordYourNuance,"What I took away from this is that he is a very intelligent guy in a high pressure situation to always say the right thing and well trained and capable of learning how to live up to that requirement. Not genuine, just well-coached on how to answer tough questions. My main assessment of this view of his politician-like response anytime you asked him to steal-man something. I didn't sense anything truly genuine, but a good show put on by the front-man for a multi-billion dollar organization. As I would kind of suspect."
Dark_Winter,Yeah. Never gonna buy a digital shirt that costs as much as a real one. Never going to buy meta stock either. Don't trust his vision at all.
NinjaButtpirate,facebook needs to release a patch notes where ever they add or change algorithms
Chris Parker,"Well, Zucc passed the Turing test. Now what?"
godly04,I am 100% sure Mark will flick his tongue out and catch a fly somewhere in this interview.
Brian McCarthy,"Lex.  As always.  Your bare honesty and bravery is exemplary.  I am proud of you son!  You are awesome.   Keep it up.   You ole 60 year old Firefighter friend, ME.    Thank you.  ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª.  Love will conquer the day!"
Binh Uebinger,Lex is a national treasure. Love is the way.
Vishal,1:39:10  üíØ
Ryan SM,"I actually didn‚Äôt get much out of this episode. It seemed like his responses to everything were exactly what I would have guessed, everything right up the middle of the fairway. Maybe I missed it, but I think that he should have to answer for whether the world is any better off for Facebook existing, since so many feel like it‚Äôs a solid ‚Äúno.‚Äù"
Marky Boy,"Meta, banning any questioning of jibby jabby things..Free speech eh? üòí"
sam cummings,21:56 Is the first time I have ever heard Mark legitimately laugh.
Tammy Seguin,"I wondered 5 minutes in, if I will get through it. 50 minutes in, I'm glad I can't be brain washed. His outlook is minimal.  To straddle every person in the name of certainly, like reading their fkbk was a hint of what to do next. I know some people that weren't honest, make up stories to draft attention. 
The games, my mom loves the games. She made an account in my name to send herself stuff for the game. I ended up playing. Not the best decision. I realized items sent , not always received. Time eater and no benefit. In front of the computer almost2 years. Didn't know it was about friends, until I clicked on an icon. It read up words of 350 PEEPS.  Never realized how many I knew."
Zakaria El ouardi,"1:26:00 i really liked how you respond, props to zuckerberg to listen to you carefully without interrupting. i love discussion like this!"
Jeremy Pappas,"I don't really understand. Mark seems like a very articulate, good natured, focused human being. Why does everyone talk so much smack on him?"
Joe does youtube,"Social media plays out like this: 

Start social media account to follow friends/family/celebrity or expand network and relationships etc."
marie harris,"ZUCKERBERG is a despicable ROBOT , I CANNOT FIND WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE HARM HE HAS DONE TO THIS COUNTRY."
Ian Graham,"Wow, I have new found respect for Mark Zuckerberg! He's actually a very interesting person, not like the media's portrayal of him."
Damien Labonte,"And God Said
Go forth 
And make money for the ShareHolders
And on the Third Day"
Bahram Assadollahzadeh,"Thank you Lex Fridman and Mark Zuckerberg for this interview. Very valuable, especially loved 1:26:59 on truth, experts, responsibility of scientists to communicate better, battle of ideas instead of censorship. As well as 1:30:55 on how critics do not understand how difficult it is for Meta to catch harmful content."
Elliot Sheedy,"Lex: ""Bathroom Break?""

Zuck: (I don't make pee, what a redundant procedure) ""Sure!"""
Angelo Delgado,I love that Mark has a tan line like he was using Oculus in a beach in Maldives
Gyanjit Mahapatra,This was good
Mr Willis,"Was going really well until Mark claimed Social Media doesn't polarise people. As an experiment, set up a Twitter account as a florist following florists versus following an extremist group."
kokuz0512,Oh great. The idea of great future for his kids  is a lot more hippies and artists. Not in my future. I‚Äôm thinking more Ai and robots so we can be lazy and take more vacations. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
midwayer godman,"Very interesting and valuable to see that Mr. Zuckerberg is a human being with thoughts, philosophies and children. It helps me to realize there‚Äôs more to him than what I think about Facebook."
Kyle Boyd,"Respectfully, Lex, you're off the mark on the blame being on scientists for lack of communication. 

When a majority of the population believes an imaginary person in the sky determines the outcome of their lives, on a whole, you cannot possibly convince them of these scientific concepts."
anshu neelkanth,This Man is proud of.. Blood he has within... of this mother earth...who can take it... None great leaders can
swatantra sohni,Fix something that hasn't broken.. scares the shit out of me !!
Noah Zork,"Oh no! A giant EMP has hit the city and we have no light.. If only we had a sorce of light that didn't  require  electricity...

What's that Mark?"
its Jammbi,another WEF member ur interviewing lex??? Nice üëçüèª
shinsui x sadness,"I was anxiously awaiting this episode for the past month, and the wait was so worth it."
vivekraman,"Instead of traffic lights, Lex should have given Zuckerberg data sets and asked him to circle the ones that Facebook can monetize."
Simon Marsh,"The best podcast that I've seen as mark has always been a mystery to me but that exposed to me his human side and how extremely hard the decision he has to make, he has also got to be one of the most  intelligent people that I've ever seen."
10:13 Neil Carter,He seemed really cool. That was a good idea.
MichaTheLight,Oh Mark got the permission from the Cia to attend a pod cast. It must be strange to be just the cover and strawmen for one of the biggest Psyops in the world. When others decide what's really happening and you pretend it's just a normal company and I'am really it's boss
Chaitanya Kulavadhuta,"I feel profoundly repelled and disgusted watching this robotic, emotionally disconnected interaction."
Song Hero,"What we need Mark is a smart man to invent something to free our people not enslave us ,why are you wasting your God given gift ,be a real Hero for Humanity!"
Rafael Toledo,"the year is 2027, bots dominate podcasts"
Lizard,"Lex: Do you fear death?

Mark: So I do a lot of extreme sport..."
Crypto Lyndon,this whole podcast ep confirms why mark should not build a metaverse and its the good builders job to keep building in the space and establish up before him. he also said Facebook/meta is neutral thats a complete lie.
YakiCart,Thank you so much for this interview brother lix Fridman keep going and sharing like these interviews Salam
Alex Kr√ºger,"Well i hatte him, because he works together with governments and the Military complex."
Jade Freeman,"i have no problems with anything Mark has done with technology, made some cools stuff, but ""without making it painfully apparent to him that he's being diluted to 10%"", all the seas of Neptune will not wash that from his hands"
Sonja Ullman,"At 35.10
It is every persons, using any social media platform, own responsibility to behave good on the internet.
In Sweden?
A few years back in time almost everyone I know only backstabbed eachother constantly."
Commenter McCommentFace,Lex interviewing a sentient cyborg truly brings this show full circle
Andrey Gizdov,"Idk why but I'm just getting this vibe from Mark: ""I'm controlling the fate of humanity and I know it"""
Cameron Peters,"2hrs of my life i wish i could get back. 
I feel you really ""censored"" the questions you could of asked and skimped out. 
This man caused massive harm to peoples lives in 2020 and you gave him all the outs he needed to advert the real answers we needed. Hopefully you Didn't pay him for this."
444thetruth,"""I mean, we're very visual. So compared to other animals"" ü§î 0.13.28 .. I am NOT an animal ! Thanks üëç"
Nick Zhang,"As much as people hating on Meta, I beleive they are doing great things with virtual reality or ""metaverse"". It's going to be our inevitable future, and standards/protocals needs to be made. Having a billion dollar company hring the smartest people working on this is beneficial for everyone."
illougal nation,Thunderbolts Project the electrical universe üôå
AJ,"Honestly, I find much of the technology interesting... however, i think the default business model is what ends up causing the problems  for people. I would love to say I knew the solution for a big company like Meta to be able to have to fix it but idk if those can exist in the same plane."
Ashley K,He seems at ease with the tech questions and extremely uncomfortable with the ones surrounding censorship. He also doesn't seem to understand the question surrounding his unlikeability.
CannonC0cker,This was a superb conversation with Mark and really helped me to understand his humanity and his vision.  Thanks for continuing to take on these challenging topics and helping to build collective understanding of the world around us.
CANTWEALL GETALONG,Did Lex ask him who his favorite dictator is?  I couldn't stomach the irrelevant questions.
Alex Vondormon,"Would love to know what drugs Mark is on, it's like he's lost all identity to being human and he's just a preprogrammed answer machine."
George Paul,Just wish you would have asked him about bullying by one political viewpoint? perhaps one that he aligns with.
Weston Adams,"Tom at MySpace did it right... Build it, sell it, make millions, and enjoy life..  Mark is trying so hard to be the face of facebook, but it is the US governments.. He should have sold it and enjoyed his life.. Instead, we get to make infinite robot memes about him and blame him for everything that is wrong with facebook.."
leanne rowell,Very interesting made him look human
Mapping the Agora,"Lex has mastered the art of balancing compassion and total honesty, with people who otherwise might not be so exposed and transparent. He allows people to answer however they want to, even if they choose to be opaque, closed off, or even dishonest. It's open for us to witness and wonder, and figure out what's really happening. There is a fascinating human experience to witness where they may be honest, and actually believe some of the things others see as lies. "
I lOVE LAW N ORDER,No thanks mark.Theres a reason organic is better and more expensive the artificial.It certainly makes the world an interesting place though .I think man will have all this AI + love and organic human interaction that can exist simultaneously.
Kevin Merendino,An alternate digital monetization is where it will go. Not tied to reality-based monetization. Meta credit transfers to $ (or reverse) will become the top dog.
Max Marzocchi,the intro was deep
Matthew Askar,Mark seemed pretty human and normal here
Murad Pervez,Bro the guy is literally using the war to promote social media use. Lmao what's wrong with y'all thinking he's a reformed person?
Kelvin Del Monte,Thank you Lex. You inspire me to become a better man every time I watch your podcast.
Mgenth bjpafa,"The suggested criterion of recruiting is interesting, would I work for this person?"
Luke Durkin,You can see how fluid mark speaks about technical issues but as soon as The discussion enters the human realm he speaks with staccato and is very hesitant.  He‚Äôs not being honest.
FortCastle VGN,"cho gath in league of legends is a dragon eating kinda weird ass monster with many legs,, but he wore a toxeedo,,, i was like LOL NICE HOW they made it fit"
David Harness,"The NFT of the shirt world, I've heard it all. No doubt this will happen.Doh!"
Celia Jn Baptiste,They will get trapped in the Meta.
Person of Interest,I never fail to learn from you Lex. Thank you from my heart to yours. Granny from South Africa üáøüá¶üíû
Weller Vision,"Yes, I'm older and have no technological acumen, but all his blather says to me ""I don't like being a human being because everyone hates my human being so I'll invent a world where there are no more humans who can personally hurt me"". He is very sad and my hope is that the world rejects his lack of human compassion and move toward making the world and humans a more beautiful place to exist. Going to appreciate the world for as long as I live and grateful I won't ever have to live in a Mark Zuckerberg world."
R O C K E A S T W O O D,"Well done, Lex. You've become a true force to land a interview of this ilk. Bravo."
ludo japn,"How does one make ""the most human experience possible"" when he is a robot?"
C P,Wondering why he didn't ask him about the Rohingya sueing Facebook for ¬£150bn over Myanmar genocide? Could imagine Zuckerberg wouldn't agree to the podcast unless certain questions were contracted out ?
Resonance,Awesome.
Edge of Time Productions,"That was a really interesting Meta commercial. Should have asked him what his justification was for deplatforming the leader of the free world, the POTUS and why he thinks he even has the right to do that at all."
–è–æ–Ω –ú–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω,Creative in a very destructive and negative way.
Nikkiana Jones,"Great heartfelt intro Lex, thank you! Why do we want to have this level of augmentation or simulation, I get that we might technically be able to but why is that desirable?"
spawnjg,Now now mark.  Your algorithms can't distinguish between sarcasm/satire or any human emotion.
Based Kaiser,He‚Äôs not that lizardy when he‚Äôs allowed to just speak his mind.
D C,Why dont they have a bully button on every post. it could be pressed by anyone and then FB get involved.
Lioniser236,"Notice how Lex begins by reeling off a list of societal failures and atrocities.  In the face of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, why would he make these points? Isn't it like reminding a family whose house has burned down that their neighbours have lost the majority of their family in a car accident?"
Mr Rivera,This alien needs to fix how to get accounts that were disabled for no reason back.
Cody Sutterfield,"Lex you are changing our world and how we look at the people in it by who you talk too, the words you say and question you ask, and by your actions of always staying yourself. Thank you. Your more powerful then what you know. Your love and deep concern of understanding and sharing it with the world help all of us who watch."
Liz Taylor,Lex your solo intro left me speecless.
Sam West,"I almost had to stop listening when The Zuck asserted that the research showed that social media didn't drive affective polarization... And then, ""We're not a partisan company.""
Uh huh..."
brayden.,"""Constraints are helpful."""
Ben Dol,He's so short sighted it quite crazy.
CaliCal68,"Mark, get in touch with me, I have ideas that would convince people metaverse will work!"
Sam S,"My perspective on Mark is way different after listening to this conversation. He's in a position where he can't really win because of the power he holds. I hope he stays as close as possible to the vision the Founding Fathers had to Free Speech. Misinformation and disinformation is not a problem by the platform it's a problem amongst the people in terms of awareness, education, and trust."
T.M. Ivey,This sounds like Second Life which has been around for ages. Just higher quality.
jester,"Just started watching this. As a tech engineer, I find myself wanting to get away from the digital world more and more, when I'm not working ... not the other way around. Maybe it's because I grew up in a rural environment with a tight community ... those who have not experienced that are seriously missing out."
Eric B√§cker,"He takes classes to be likeable and yet he is still one of the most hated and hateable ""humans"" on the planet."
CleverGirlAAH,I dont know why everyone is praising this. It was a 2 hour ad for the metaverse. He turned every straightforward question into a sales pitch for digital clothes and business meetings.
jelybrd,"Lex: 100101101
Mark: 00110101

Jk Lex is great"
Kathryn Grace,"I just have to say, it‚Äôs too difficult to watch this heartless, soulless android who basically wants to delete humanism. I can‚Äôt put this into my energy or consciousness because it feels so evil to me IMO of course. 
Sorry Lex, I would rather absorb someone who truly cares about Humanity & has solutions to assist us in this incredible transition we find ourselves. I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, Lex, however not for me‚Ä¶."
Davin Hiscock,"Venom laughed , entering the human host ."
TheAaronRodgersTao,"That is one of the most beautiful monologues I have ever heard‚Ä¶.. God bless you Lex, and this/you is why you are such a beacon of hope and light for humanity. Gives me joy to hear how you are so joyfully human in the best sense possible."

Master Debater,No no no‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre just re-educating people! It‚Äôs not the same.
zDevos,He doesnt live in the real world. Him saying social media hasnt contributed to the divide in America is lunacy...
Sebastian Lo Monaco,What possible reasons do we need to be in a meta verse when we have reality. Only nefarious reasons.
Sgt.StickyTits,Did this machine pass the Turing test?
T K,"Lex is a class act. Always balancing professionalism with engagement. Mark wasn‚Äôt held to answers on the most difficult questions, but I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs the intention of Lex‚Äô podcast. 

Overall, great interview. It was nice to hear Mark talk about the importance of helping others, choosing the right friends, and the value of family. Learn these things early in life."
M- Nice,Mark says why wouldn't I spend as much money for my avatar's close as in the real world LOL let me think Mark because we are not all billionaires and that is just silly.  Man he sure is out of touch with the users in his platform.
Kekt,"I like my VR, however, there's gotta be a better way to make these things more comfortable on my head."
john lennox,Watch out for DXO extremely under valued and miss understood.
em00k,I actually came away from this liking Mark more. Well done.
chasmlore,"8:41

What was that?"
Ryan Perrin,Who had the idea that we should let two of the best General AI robots have a conversation?
M- Nice,I don't think humans will or should have a dominant life in a digital virtual reality.
Keeran MNC,"Thanks Lex for this episode. It's one of the most interesting and insightful one's I've watched on the channel. The beginning and middle was an interview, the latter half turned into a proper conversation and so was more interesting for me. The interview line of questioning on mainstream media criticisms was however important - it gave me a completely new view of the problem space they're working in and the man grappling with these problems for years. He is fundamentally not a malevolent man - as was evident by the answers to your existential questions at the end about choosing one question for God and the meaning of life - and therefore the premises of the Social Dilemma and other mainstream media criticisms are invalid. As a family man, I appreciate the genuine tension he feels between the importance of realizing his full potential, his legacy and making an impact on the world, verses the importance of his family. Too many entrepreneurs seemed to have chosen the former and didn't sufficiently see the importance of their families, eventually getting divorced (Elon, Jobs, Gates, Bezos). Mark seems to take the significance of this tension more seriously. Wise man."
Dan Craig,Please ask all your friends how to supply free internet to Russia. We have to break through Putin's alternate reality.For their freedom and ours. Save Ukraineüá∫üá¶
Anderson Clark,"As the economic crisis keep rising one needs to have different streams of income, as well secure a profitable investment for the future.detailed diversified investment portfolio in the financial markets is needed to survive!

Jason Lynch,"I won't touch anything w Zuck's stink on it, Meta will be no exception to this"
Mattia Micheletta,I want lex home tour
Ih8u 69,"Wow! Thank you Lex and Mark for doing this interview. I‚Äôve been waiting for these types of interviews/debate/conversation with Mark to make an opinionated view in regards to him and his views. Please tell Mark he should do other podcasts to help people understand him and who he is, and not have memes and the corporate media tell us all. This interview kinda reminds me of the first (of many now) that I saw of Elan on Joe‚Äôs podcast. Elan, he was to far out of left field for 99% of people but now we get him. These type of leaders or visionaries and investors are the type of people I think we should be supporting. On a side note please tell Mark that less control is better then too much when it comes to speech."
Niels Gehm,"If Mark is the lizard, then what is Lex? ‚ò∫"
Cole Lehner,This guy is a fucking genius and people fear what they don't understand technology is not evil its just how it can be used like it or not this guy has reshaped the world and brought people across boarders together on a level never thought possible we're still in the beginning of social media we haven't seen how it will evolve overtime yet just because you don't understand it doesn't make it bad
ndgo,I wonder where his battery compartment is located?
G3M1N1J0K3R,sooner or later the people will drop social media...only a matter of time. those weirdos at the hubs keep getting caught. it all adds up and people get fed up.
Yuliana Pleshakova,Thank you for genuinely trying to see and understand what's going on nowadays and being honest and open-minded with your listeners. üíõ
Luke,"Such an incredibly boring interview, Lex asked some great questions but Zuckerturd just answers as if he reads from a company mission statement every single time he answers. It is deeply concerning that he has so much influence in society today."
Paul Adamson,Facebook can be a very good tool.  I use it to publicly document my physics work and to engage in mutually beneficial discussions.
Mark Hall,Suckerburg better be worried. What happens when china does take over? Facebook and other social media is not allowed. He goes out of business üòÇ
T√ºrk Oyuncu,Doing It Stealthy is one of those songs that makes you ask.... why did God create us? What happens after we die?
Homesteading France,Looking at a photo is not the same as looking down from the top of the mountain.
2005jes2005,"This is the most emotionally charged intro I ever saw. I mean that in a positive sense. Then you say you fear nothing. I believe this is not true. Fear is one of the cards in the deck that life has depended on since forever. 
Fear is not failure."
Scott Rose,"Human beings are not wired to function as a global tribe.  We are wired to care for our local tribe, defined for generations, as a localized group of humans that we interact with in the physical world on a daily basis. We only survive with the help (love) of those around us.  The advent of personal global communication technology has created a rift in our evolution, a massive gap now separates our inherent evolutionary path from one of necessary compassion for those around us, to one of overwhelming confusion about where we fit into the ""global tribe"".  These ""tools"" were unleashed on humanity with no regard for the massive effect it would have on our basic beliefs and how it would contradict our very nature and derail our evolutionary path."
cmartinez89,How you get these people harder to reach than the president is beyond me.
Sean Fitzgerald,"a big issue i have with  the metaverse is that seems like a failure to ""read the room"" so to speak.....i mean everyone has been virtual and isolated from IRL interactions for 2 plus years now.....is something that keeps us in virtual interaction really what we need now?"
Hugo Henriques,"To my man Lex,
Thank you so much for this interview. Thanks for not shying away from the important questions and to allow him to respond. You're doing great work! Keep at it! üôÇ

Indigo Leavell,I honestly hope this reaches you. I am inspired by you. Thank you for your optimism and influence. I love your podcasts. I've listened to you for years and you've actually gotten me through difficult times.
SV,Looks so life like!
Sam S,"Lex makes a good point at 1:29:00, maybe Facebook should host debates between pro-mandate and anti-mandate scientists. Publicly broadcast and fund on Facebook these debates so the public knows where everyone stands."
Black HalfnHalf,"Lex....bro you NEVER cease to continuously amaze me. Please don't ever stop being the beacon of light and hope people like myself need to keep our heads up high and remain hopeful and strong in the face incredible adversity. Love you man, keep killing it"
Adam West,"Never stop being yourself lex, I hope one day the world will have more people like you in it."
For my Son,So this is what it looks like when two androids talk to each other....
Dan Powell,"Love the new intro idea bud. I'm about to settle in and watch this interview because I've been waiting for it, should be interesting. Thanks for all that you do Lex üôèüí™"
Frederick Hofmann,he is actually not too bad at talking in this format. huh
Adrian Riley,Would be great to get him on again and ask about Event 2 0 1 (3 months before the first case of the fludemic) addressing the fact that social media platforms will need to play their part in shaping the narrative. Great interview! Thanks Lex!
loose goose,"Thanks so much for doing this getting to hear what mark thinks is important, since he gets nothing but a bad rap in the media, only fair to have a in depth conversation like this."
Renee,"Great job somewhere in the beginning I was just waiting for you to say ""this is the Twilight zone"" but I loved it you're great, great job and I hope you do get to follow up on your dreams and also I hope to be able to see it on YouTube one day.. great job kiddo"
Ren Anave,This dudes lying the whole interview lmao
Tris,Thanks Lex & Mark for the great convo.
Andrei Stan,"Suck a despicable way to answer those questions‚Ä¶ 90% of the questions were answered in the most political correct way possible.
Way know the commercial nonsense, we know it! Just answer the damn questions in a less CEO way."
JimmyDShea,That opening monologue had me tearing up üôèüèºüíú
Ajay Bhandari,"Thanks Lex for doing this and giving us an opportunity to hear MZ's story and perspective. 
On the social dilemma topic,  I think the complex fabric of our society & world ensures that ""short term incentives"" will be prioritized over ""long term intentions"" and result in emergent phenomenon like polarization in society etc. I wish you could have pushed a little bit more in that direction. We have all seen unintentional consequences rising from such global scale social network where a low single digit of ""polarized & misinformed people"" can  then be agents amplifying that through other networks. "
Nathan Richins,Loved to see Mark's passion for human connection as being his main motivator. Gives him a much more personable feel
Cole Lehner,This guy is a fucking genius and people fear what they don't understand technology is not evil its just how it can be used like it or not this guy has reshaped the world and brought people across boarders together on a level never thought possible we're still in the beginning of social media we haven't seen how it will evolve overtime yet just because you don't understand it doesn't make it bad
Authentic Existence,"So between the episode with the Pfizer CEO and this one, I'm officially giving up on this Podcast,  it is beyond frustrating and so cringe to watch Lex consciously NOTdo whats right.... instead of politely and respectfully calling out blatant BS & proven lies of the corrupt establishment, he carries their coat tails, on his knees... swallowing their lies whole sale as if he wasn't incredibly intelligent & aware of their injustices!"
Working Prole inc.,"Wow The Robots are advanced!!
What is his name 
Mark Metaverse?"
Fox M,"56:46 ""we're not a partisan company"" LOL

He donated a MILLIONS to Democrats. Not to mention the blatant misuse of community guidelines against conservative voices."
Native Manatee Roughskins,"Hey Mark, in some other countries they aren't born with unalienable rights given to them by there forefathers, men who were masters of their own destinies."
NotLegal,1:31:34 You can see it in Marks expression how Lex actually got Mark deeply thinking about what Lex said which is very good. Thank you Mark and Lex. EDIT: timestamp
YellowKing,What a fluff piece.
Dale Ch,"Very, very interesting conversation Lex - this has changed my outlook and opinion on Mark Zuckerberg - in quite a positive way I might add ü§î"
Chip Mcdonald,"Possibly the most unwatchable interview ever.  Watch his lecture at MIT from long ago; he's now deliberately trying to come off android like for effect, or for the sake of obfuscation."
Michael,Showing your arms might feel weird if the elbow angle is wrong but I think it would add to the experience if others could see the arms and
Mario E.,12:11 - So there's Alexa; Sophia and Mark's codename is 'Jessica'.
J√∂ck≈ì P√∏√±,"Thank you Lex, I've spent the last year considering suicide and hearing your introductions, especially this one, help me more than I can say. Life and Death are cyclical, I only hope wars end asap with as little suffering as possible so we can begin rebuilding cities, lives and relationships...yes I'm an idealist lol"
Mercedes G,"I‚Äôm glad I watched this. I never thought Mark Zuckerberg would ever make me cry! But he did! üò¢ And no, I‚Äôm not PMS-ing either. His answers for the last questions were so sincere and so sweet! I felt his softness and depth. Also, he‚Äôs a girl dad; there‚Äôs nothing sweeter or softer in this world than a girl dad! They have a special place in my heart, because I had the best girl dad ever.  üíó Beautiful conversation! Thank you for having it and sharing it with the world."
Ethan Satcher,Lol mark polarization didn‚Äôt decrease because you banned those who disagree
Vince D,He gave him way too much time to think of an answer while he rambled on about freedom of speech stuff...
Christopher McCarthy,Mark doesn't feel FULL STOP.
MD fakhrudin,May be first billionaire in lex's podcast.
Deniz Cihan,"The response from Lex at 01:27:50 is damn important, truthful and would solve as an approach from its core so many problems."
Damn Yankee‚Äôs Daughter,His voice or opinion is not any more valid than any other that was silenced for disagreeing with him
Adam Eve,"Thanks, that was a nice and cordial interview. 
I feel like Mark is my best friend now."
Nothingness,"I think when you ask what would I do, I would do exactly what you have done with Lex, show the human side of you as a person.  It‚Äôs so warming to hear the values and kindness that you pursue for the world.  Be good, do good.  Love Matt"
Luke Trader,"Another Great interview, thanks Lex. 
I can‚Äôt imagine that we are ever going to feel the same chemistry in the Metaverse! 
If we did, no one would ever leave!"
David Hughes,If I could invest in anything it would be Blackrock
John Bossnack,My father and his parents fled Ukraine in 1942 from the Soviets only to go right into the hands of the Nazis...it was from the frying pan into the fire...they suffered greatly by both sides...this war happening today to the Ukrainian people is a real sadness in my heart.
nik7drum7,You will be arrested and put on trial for all your machinations and lies. And your company is torn apart by litigation risks.
Jonathon Thomas,"I‚Äôve gotta say, my preconceived notions of who I thought this man was were completely wrong. He may make some troubling decisions but he is still a human being and I think that gets lost in the mainstream narrative. I came away from this very curious and open minded about what Mark has to offer society over the next decade."

IamKyros,"Mark looked taken back (in a positive way) when asked the last few questions about death and meaning in life. Props to Lex, he asked very powerful questions and kept his composure lol. Its not an everyday thing to have mark sit down with you."
Mark Little,Your interviews and investigative journalism are by far the best on YouTube and also the best compared to any Main Stream Reporter. You are wise beyond your years. Thanks for sharing your perspective and doing all the hard work to bring your perspective and conversations to us.

Jamie Salmon Sculpture,"Amazing interview...well done Lexüëèüëèüëè Zuck frightens me even more now after watching him talk. Good God! You'd think him and his company were the most altruistic thing since sliced bread! Truly terrifying. He's a master at fielding and answering questions, and very smart. Plus I'm sure his lawyers trained him well."
Rebecca Torrez,he literally never laughs
FeralSpirit,"You are such a brilliant, insightful, and courageous young man, as well you seem to embody a wisdom, sincerity, and humility beyond your years.  Im so damned impressed by you."

If_then,"Great conversation Lex, I haven't heard Zuckerberg in this light before"
Nemanja 369,"Whoever wants to live in the virtual world is a fool not capable of comprehending the consequences of that choice. Your depression will not be cured by some virtual Wonderland, but by you changing your habits and your perspective. You need to have discipline in your life, some valuable goals, passion, and ambition. I know that mental patterns are hard to modify, let alone break, but it's necessary if you want to live a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life. Programming that you went through is unfair but you still have the power to change YOU and YOUR life. Virtual ""world"" of some form can be good for education and entertainment, I don't deny that, but it can't compensate or substitute the real world as we know it."

SOURCEDBLACK,Dutch people think FB and more general US media is kind of prude. If you see a nipple or use fuck in a sentence. It‚Äôs kind of funny to us. But also a little fake. That being said liked the interview
Jacqueline Larsen,"Mr. Zuckerberg is an atheist. But let's get one thing straight. Atheism is not the knowledge that God does not exist, but only the wish that He does not, in order to sin without reproach or exalt ones ego without challenge. The pillars which atheism mounts are sensuality and pride, but mostly pride."
lennon john,Meta verse im going there
Marcia Millard,Lex you are a renaissance man!  Loved your conversation and your questions were awesome.
