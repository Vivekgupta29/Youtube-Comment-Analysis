Rishabh Gupta,"Best explanation of API, clearing all the doubts 👍👍"
Virendra SINGH,"Good explanation but i think there's one more aspect of APIs you didn't mentioned is that.. API can be helpful when you are in any kind of development phase but you don't want to waste your time in some very basic coding, so you request/choose API providers for it. But i think it's just because you didn't wanted to go into deep and you wanted to keep your video simple. Please correct me if I'm wrong at any point."
Rachana A,"I am a UI designer and maine socha API simple bhasha me kitna simple ho sakta hai.... but sahi me video dekh ke mere khudke bi concepts clear hue hai... amazing talent!

Shudhanshu bisht,"One more example by me😊read it
Imagine you are sitting at a table in a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from. The kitchen is the part of the ""system"" that will prepare your order. what is missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table . That's where the waiter or Api comes in. The waiter is the messenger - or API- that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen - the system - what to do. then the waiter delivers the response back to you; In this case, it is the food."
