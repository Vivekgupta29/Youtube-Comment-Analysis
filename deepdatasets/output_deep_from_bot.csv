Amazing Facts,"H- having 
A- anger
T- towards
E- everyone"
Marko Šćepanović,"If you have hate comments on your videos, keep going. That means you’re on the good way to build your audience."
Wolffy,"Don't feed the troll

That's basically what you should do, and ignore them, because you're awesome!"
RuffFusion,"The best thing to do is don't feed them or give them what they want, walk all over them and just carry on following your passion and doing what you love.

Facebook is the worst place for trolls."
Lil Crafty Nook,"This is SO needed!!  When a well known YTer engages with trolls in his live-streams, I feel it takes away from the others who truly have legitimate questions.  Love your B-roll!"
Al's Action English,"No hate here. Only LOVE - another brilliant video, Nick - you always go above and beyond. "
ShaddyMD,"I don’t really get bothered by haters, but the fact that any person can be so angry to lash out at a stranger unprovoked makes no sense to me. There’s some really cruddy angry trolls with zero sense of respect or decency out there, hiding behind their keyboards. Thanks for this video! Def best to ignore them, they’re not even worth a minute of anyones time or energy."
,"""Unpleasant"" is such a pleasant description!  When I hide someone, I call it ""talking to the wind"". They can talk but no one can hear them but themselves. Love it!"
Super Joe Pardo,"I reply to them with: ""I appreciate you watching and commenting."" I have had several flip their negative, hateful comments around, apologize, and/or keep watching. I actually just released a video where I read many of my negative comments and reply to them more in-depth than just saying ""I appreciate you"". Thanks, Nick for the tip on hiding them from the channel, that is what I came looking for as another way to do deal with the deepest hurt commenters that come to the channel."
,"i love haters , because they care about our channel"
Jess Stanley,"Thanks so much Nick! This came at a good time for me! Noticing more rude people as my channel grows, I HAVE to remember not to take it personally! Thanks for what you do. You helped me to run a better channel!!"
Ivy Phan,"When I just started YouTube I didn't expect to get so many haters because my videos are all sunny and positive

But then I saw an opportunity and made a video calling out those haters, and the video BLEW UP "
Cabin Dweller,"Yes, don’t engage at all! I always wonder why some people do yet they ignore the polite comments."
,Negative comments are a great tool for learning how to improve the content. It's good to know the difference between negative and troll.
Time For Elohim!,"I've had multiple trolls, and I've just started making videos. Great advice Nick!"
,Thanks for this :)
YourInnerWolfe,"Hey Nick, I had just heard about you while searching for this kind of answer. Both being a content creator (and an adult) for some reason I just felt a bit lost on how to deal with this sort of thing even though I already knew how. It never hurts to just be reminded by someone every now and then, so thank you for giving me the morale boost I needed! "
,"Thank you Very Much , Nick"
SummerGalaxyWolf,"I loved your hater skits, Nick! xD They make the video all the more interesting and entertaining! Also, thanks a million for all the advice you put out. You're awesome! :D"
Art by April,This helps I occasionally get unwanted creepy flirty comments now I can just hide them
Icha Ayu,"This video came out at the right moment for me. Received a lot of mean comments recently. Body shaming, threat and even sexual harrassement. It's hard to deal with at first but when I read positive comments it encourages me to create more contents. Thank you Nick!"
Serious Keto,"Thanks for this perspective, Nick. One of the downsides I experience in being very interactive with my channels community is that I wind up reading all the nasty comments. I’ve been called every horrible name, had sexual comments made about my family, had death wished upon me by various means, and been physically threatened. "
Stephen Bahr,“I’ll show him !” That was hilarious  . Yep I’ve got haters that follow me around from platform to platform. . Thank you for the video . Well done 
Boomer Shroomer,It is so hard not to take the mean comments personally. I appreciated your video. Thanks Nick <3
Dine in Psychology,"Hi Nick! Really enjoyed this video and really needed to hear this today. Newer to YouTube and generally, can let most of the troll comments roll off my back but every once in a while one will take me by surprise! You hit the nail on the head, by ignoring negative behavior, it extinguishes it. I’m a therapist and this is so on point— good reminder for me to hear this! : ) Appreciate all the hard work you do. Thank you for your channel!"
Kirky Plays,"The TL;DR of this video is: ""Don't feed the trolls.""

Yup. Still holds true to this day. Even still though, it can be soooo tempting to give them just a nibble at times."
Clay Disarray,"This is such an important issue to cover, Nick - thank you for the tips! Luckily I haven't had any real hate as yet, but realistically I know it'll come one day."
Joe Cox-Autism Vlogger,"Thank you so much for this video, Nick. I really needed this after I was trolled a few months ago on a video I did about what it's like to attend college and have autism. I have an autism diagnosis and the person called me nasty names and said I should kill myself. But--when I learned about the ""Hide Comments from Channel"" feature, it was a true godsend. Thank you, Nick. "
CosmicFlare,"This is exactly the tip I used last year when I had some hate comments. I just hid them so that they don't spook my beloved fans and boy, it worked like magic."
Enneawiring,"Thanks for the video Nick. I love to use ""hide user from the channel"" option on haters and trolls, it's an amazing feature to deal with them! Keep it up!"
Rudrajit Das,"Watching after 2years of uploading, but still relevant and will remain so. 
Thank you for uploading such a  content. Really needed for youngsters nowadays when our every comment is replied with a bully, religious hate speech or by using slang against our mothers. And That creates mental stress for us. Thank you man for solving these issues."
The Spirit of the Cosmos,"Thank you Nick watching now Brother! I always say haters, trolls, and mean people just need a hug . I shine love unto them with Spiritual practice and it pops their balloon rather quickly.   ️ ️"
Real Appeal Gaming Entertainment,I haven’t had this problem yet but I appreciate your words of wisdom Nick! Good PSA for mature content creators.
Heidi Stevenson,Thank you for creating this video! I received my first hate comment and googled what I could do and your video came up! Definitely great advice to not give them what they want in a response.
Jason Bonnicksen,"Thank you for your advice. I received my first hater critique last night. I almost want to celebrate. As a former pastor (and dealing with the bleacher critics a lot), I COMPLETELY agree with you. I'm really digging your content, and you're helping me ""reframe"" my channel and my growth mentality."
Ted Mattos,"You're a good man, Mr. Nimmin - reminding us that even the negative people out there are people who are dealing with struggles of their own and that engaging in them doesn't help them. I hope someday I'll be big enough to even GET negative comments! LOL - Thanks again for the useful advice!"
Phienixx,"I’ve noticed these trolls have no content on their own channel. Zero! They don’t have the balls to put themselves out there. It’s easier for you them to hide behind a computer or device and judge other people. Just like in real life, real life haters hate you because they hate themselves in some way. They need to do some deep inner work."
SHOUKATH ALI,"Stay Positive.
Spread Positivity.
Learn, Earn & Grow Positively."
,"Great advice! Thank you Nick! I've followed all your tips since the creation of my channel and they were all very helpful. In the last 28 days I got monetized and all of a sudden my channel grew from 2K to over 20K in less than 28 days, which is GREAT but also came with a bunch of trolls and I was looking for the best way to deal with that and you helped me once again. THANK YOU"
,Great video Nick! Very informative and entertaining man!
A Horror Writer Plays,Thanks Nick. We're working to grow from a small place and already having this happen. This video was super helpful from a lot of different angles.
Still October,I got my first extremely negative hater who literally everyday writes a new rude comment on allll my videos and I tried to ask him why he felt the need to hate me so much. He never responds to me but I’m so thankful for your words. I need to not take it personally. It’s hard but I have to learn. Thank you this made me feel better about the situation️️️
N,Hey Nick! Hope you're doing well. I recently started getting plenty of dislikes on my videos and I started wondering maybe I said something in a video that made some people hate me. Do you think it's as deep as that or is it just shallow hate? Sorry for asking a confusing question like this but I'm getting depressed because I didn't get dislikes on EVERY video before.
Dandelion Plaza,"Hi Nick! Thank you for making this video, seeing hate comments towards the videos I make just ruins my motivation to even make videos, so thank you Nick for this tips :)"
Armitshu Games,"Every time I got some problem with my channel, I always go back here to hear some tips. Worth it as stress reliever. Tried to ignore them but it is so tempting to reply to those toxic comments."
Blue kid,Thank you for helping me because I usually call my haters stupid but you’re helping me get rid of my haters because once I expose the hate comments people start leaving even more negative comments thank you
,Great video Nick. Is definitely hard to walk away from some of the negative comments. I find almost every time I engage I end up regretting it. Thanks Nick.
Rebollion Station,"I believe that negative comments are also important and some of them have great value when it comes to improvements. But I also agree that many people simply want to take it unnecessarily far and rather just hitting the 'dislike' button also feel it is cool to give you a few words of hate. Why taking the effort to write down ""Oh it was crap"" rather than describe why was it crap?"
Robert McGill,"I appreciate you making this video, Nick. Unfortunately in this technology world we live in, it's easy for people to be cowards. I dealt with trolls before and how I deal with them is not to reply back to any negative comments they say. That's why they make the block button."
Print On Demand - RJ Martinez,Great video Nick! Thank you for making this. I was literally thinking about this for 2020..Everyone that is negative and has something mean to say is getting blocked.
Lori Blye DIY,"Absolutely perfect share, Nick!  I learned the 'Art of Ignoring' years ago ~ it's amazing, if you don't give them any fuel, they eventually move on! This video was so needed ~ I clicked on it as soon as I saw the title!! Have an awesome day, friend!!"
Shizuko Rose KTK,"My sis once told me, ""no matter what you do, theres always someone that hates you."" 

Didnt understand it until I reached 10yrs and it got clearer using the net.. :V"
Hoosierback Outdoors,Nick’s parenting advice 101. LOVE IT!! 
nararabbit1,"People who are deeply unhappy take it out on others. Even though it might get to me a little bit, having compassion for their misery makes it easier to let it go. I don’t have to encourage them with attention but I can only imagine it’d make them more enraged to get pity than a mad response."
Hal’s Guitar Adventures,"I love your perspective on this negative part of social media.
Very healthy, and inspirational. Thank you for good tips"
,Great video and excellent advice! As a Retired NYPD Detective I have said this same exact thing for the past year! Thanks for all you do!  
Midpack Mania,"Appreciate this video, for every 5 positive comments, you get 1 hater that tries to knock you off your center. Sometimes just need to hear someone else explain this, thanks Nick!"
Michael Gabuya,"Why do I love this guy?  <3 , he help and inspires me always. he always upload helpful videos , thanks bro .Do you guys feel what I feel?  :))"
Writers Room,"This video helped me a lot. Outside of this anonymous channel, I secretly have a pretty big following on instagram and a pretty mean comment kind of got to me tonight. Watching this seriously helped. Thank you Nick."
MISSed Bandwagon,"When I first got started on my channel, when I had less 10 subscribers, someone went went through ALL my videos and thumbs down’d them. I have no idea why!? I wish creator studio told you who does these things so I could report them. "
Jared MN,"Respond to constructive criticism because they might say something you can learn

Don't respond to trolls because they will end up wasting your time"
Unearthing Stories,"Here to spread some love: love your channel and your content, you do a fantastic job and have a great on-camera personality. Best wishes to you, your channel and all who watch!"
aajustjay,"Thanks Nick.  This actually came at a good time.  It's relevant to something that's happened with my other channel.  I appreciate your tips as always.  Great content, consistently awesome!"
BroadbandLink Gaming,It's like you know my struggles. Great video nick. Also love your troll skits 
Jon Stallings,Thanks Nick for the info. Will be launching my channel soon so I can implement this from the start. I also liked how you also showed some compassion for the trolls.
TevoTV,So important!  When is started with my comedy music videos people looked at me like i was crazy cause i was working a 9-5.  Until a fortune 500 company took one of my videos and made it an ad and bought the song lol!!!  Keep pushing everyone your dreams are within reach just stay consistent.
Hedge witch tarot,"This is such a needed video.  We work so hard on our channels. And when we do get those ""comments""  it does bring down the vibe lol. After a while we just get more thick skinned and realise it has nothing even to do with you. These people are deeply unhappy within themselves.  I send them peace and love and put them in the ""hide box"" lol"
Astro,Thanks for this video Nick! As someone who is getting a few viewers finally some of them are unpleasant and this is quite helpful :)
TYREESE “TJ” JOYNER,"I dealt with trollers and haters throughout 2019. I kept blocking trollers and haters along with adding blocked words. Great tips, Nick."
Tomas Arzeno,"Appreciate this video! Got a bit discouraged after receiving some negative comments but realized this only means my videos are getting out there more, no use feeding that negativity"
Rennthusiast,This is brilliant!  Loving the work you do man! 
AJ's Green Topics,I was laughing when you trolled your brother's channel. Great information Nick. 
Jose SG,"I´m doing my Phd in cyberbullying and this is very good advice, thanks Nick, love your content"
Blue Eyed Tech,This is honestly my favorite video. After dealing with toxic people in my comments I will watch this video to feel better. Thanks Nick 
420 Scene,"Yeah, sometimes haters get to me and I trash back at them and hide them from channel. Hard to just ignore but I’m getting too tired of responding to the bs comments."
DamD젠장Vlog,I love this video! Just started dealing with my first haters yesterday LOL. This video is everything. Thanks for this!
Mayank Singhal,Thank you Nick  for inspiring new creators  !!!
ZZ9 Productions,"Step 1: Delete the comments
Step 2: Block the user
Step 3: GG"
BLUDSHOTiZ,Thanks man! It can definitely ruin your day when you have 5 people watching and 1 is a troll. I know to accept they're just trolling or dont like my content but damn I'm too invested at this point to quit what I've started. 
Making It with Chef Cheri,"'This Dee Nimmin Guy,,, I'll show him""
I nearly fell off my bed laughing! "
*.* Robert G *.*,Hey Nick this is some good advice haters are every were. Most of the time it's because someone is doing something positive and they can't see anyone succeed. The key to dealing with any hater is not to engage at all sooner or later they will get tired and go away. Have a great day Nick
UltimateMoralizer,"In general, when it comes to rude people on YouTube, they usually resort to childish insults and shaming tactics because they have no arguments. I’ve noticed that anybody can get attacked for doing anything. Just ignore these type of people. Don’t feed them."
Miranda Detailing,Such awesome advice Nick!  Love you channel so much I have learned so much to help our little channel!
True Crime Detective,"Thanks Nick, I needed this today after waking up to several horrible comments about me personally. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, but equally, it's comforting to know I'm not the only one. My content matter is controversial which gets the conversation going, but it can draw in people from some very dark corners too."
RobbiiChan,"Well Nick it’s like you read my mind right before you make a video  I’ve actually been off of YouTube for a few days because haters have been getting to me, I’ve actually been hoping to see someone posts about how to deal with haters, normally I don’t get a lot but it’s been bad lately to the point it made me feel like not even posting, but I have been blocking them and I got over it and I’m actually posting a new video In like 30 minutes because I learned how to deal with it, this video taught me that I’m doing the better thing and showed me that I’m more mature than haters, thanks nick! Just thought I’d let you know I’m doing great on YouTube and I’m fully confident that I’m gonna make it on this platform thanks to your advice! Thanks again "
Passive Income Tom,I haven't had many trolls but sure they're out there.  Thanks Nick! 
Beach Bling Books,"Thank you so much for this! I've been really nervous to upload because of trolls, etc, (I don't handle confrontation well) and this is a great way to look at it. Much appreciated!"
Lady Katie,"This is helpful! I unfortunately are super confrontational and am quick to jump and start tickity tapping on my keyboard back at them. I need to stop and remind myself they nothing I say will sway them and that giving them attention won’t lead to anything positive. One thing an angry internet stranger said to me was “I am under no obligation to respect you”. That one made my blood boil because without respect where would we be? If someone refuses to respect you, and you’ve continued to be respectful throughout the whole ordeal, you won. Respect is among the most valuable things a person can have"
Vaz Survival,Thanks for the info. I had to recently deal with an “unpleasant” viewer with unnecessary negative comments after i busted my ass alone in the wilderness for 2 days. Im all about the classic saying “If you have nothing nice to say don’t say anything.”
Pikadoriya,Hey Nick I just wanna say thank you man for the big help if it wasn’t for you. I don’t think I would upload another video again.I’ve been dealing with haters for the past week and it really distraught me.I felt really uneasy Of myself At the points I didn’t want to upload another video And just move on in life. But after watching your video you really encouraged me and you made me get back up and fight and I just want to thank you.and I hope you have a bright future for your channel 
Tainted Mantis,"I do have a question about hate and harassment policies. Have you dealt with people who seem to wish cyber bullying on you and how do you handle it, aside from simply just reporting and hiding users from channel?"
Souls Journey,"Even on my tiny channel I've had to hide someone who kept coming back just to argue about something. Good way to look at it. Gonna check out that app, too, Thanks!"
Craving Crochet,Thanks Nick love the way you put this video together️
FM Language,"Awesome job, Nick! Keep up the good work!"
WithMyHandsAndHeart RachaelT,Yes! Negative people hate themselves... thanks for the tips! ♡
Rattail,"This was so helpful. We just got our first ""unpleasant"" comment - ahh! We're trying to build a super positive community so this threw me off a bit - again, thanks for the grounding in how to approach this!"
SLOSH,"If you don't have any haters, then you are probably doing something wrong 

-some unknown guy"
elise妍,"i’ve got a hater and they made me more motivated to improve but, it’s also sad :/"
Blissfully Random,"I really enjoy your content and the style you present the information. Thank you for helping out other creators, especially the small ones. :)"
Joe's Firewood Videos II,Ok.  I thought “hide” meant that I couldn’t see the comments?   Good to know.
The Miniature's Paintbrush,"Thank you so much for that advice, you are a pillar of the community!  Keep on being awesome."
Tiffany Chanell,1st time I've heard a big content creator make a video on how to handle this type of situation. Thanks for being real and sharing tips on how to handle situations like these.
Life With Lani,"As a former (x2) failed politician, I know what it is like to deal with haters. It was very difficult for me not to respond to the haters on my website/Facebook/Twitter account at first but as time went on I learned to grow a tough hide and ignore them. All they wanted to do was create problems and,  as you said, focus the attention on them and away from the issues. After dealing with politics, YouTube will be a snap. Thanks for the advice."
Mean's Woodshop,"Good advice, man. I’ve been lucky enough to evade haters (at least really nasty ones) so far, but it is something I worry about as my channel moves forward. In addition to not engaging with negative comments, I also think lashing back at a hater is representative of your channel too, so potential subscribers might not wanna scroll through and see content creators replying with equally nasty stuff."
Arena Hacks,"Incredible advice, I love the psychology at the end."
Ozzstar's Cars,I just filmed a vid on how to hide nose hairs when filming.  Should be going viral any day now. haha  Good info there Nick!
Tildi's CookBook,That one was sooooooo useful!!! Good to know... THANK YOU Nick!
Loco_Mobius PRIME,My main problem is finding a community of people who support content creation in the same way I do.
Shrimpy McGee,"I feel like there is too much onus on us as creators to moderate everything. I'm not sure what the solution is, other than maybe asking someone else to moderate your comments and weed out the nasty ones. I have a small channel, not even 3K, and the rudeness and sometimes even abuse that I'm getting daily is just so out of proportion with the content itself (hair) and my audience size. Hiding the comments feels like I have to swallow their poison because I still have to see it. Maybe I should figure out a barter with another small creator to moderate each other's comments or something! Anyway, thanks for this video Nick. Another good one!"
"Grit, Grind, Gold",Just wanted to say thanks man for consistently and consnsantly uploading kick-ass content.
Christopher Harle 1of2,"Most welcome advice, Nick Nimmin. I feel stronger already. Thanks."
SlickSawick,I always ignore them and when I see them I just do the hide user button so if they ever come back I don't have to worry about it! =)
,"Excellent advice and information, sir.  I've had a barrage of trolls, mockery, and hateful comments on some of my videos and it's become a bit of a chore to moderate them.  I don't want to disable comments because that isn't fair to everyone else (and it's also perceived as fragility) but I don't want to give negative and abusive people a platform on my channel.  Some say ""have thicker skin"" and ""accept criticism"" and those are fair points indeed.  If negative comments have a constructive element, sometimes they're worth keeping around.  YouTube provides some excellent tools for moderating comments but it can still be a lot of work to manually curate them."
VNfatBIKER Studio,Appreciated this tutorial so much Nick! I got those crazy bashers/haters/trolls hahaha....Thank you so much again Nick!
Loco_Mobius PRIME,"I love haters, it’s just weird when they call my friends trolls and don’t give actual advice on how to improve lol. “We don’t want you here” ok but why?"
Randy Schartiger,"great stuff Nick thank you for it! I have a few that follow me to the ends of the earth, did everything you said and thank them for their view count lol rock on mang!"
Hamacon,"Thank you for this one, too️ I must be getting popular to have got my first haters  thanks to your advice, they can comment whatever they like but no-one will see them anymore and they don’t even know that "
Tripods Garage,"People block, even if offer positive“non-trolling” advice.  I have a video of my commute to work on crutches, really cannot believe how many dislikes I have for it."
Paulo Lopez,I loved this video. Honestly this is the best way to go about it. (Also loved the extra bits you put in like the trolling Dee part )
OFF THEGRILL,Good one..️Alchemy

Awesome Lps Tv!!,"This helps me so much! Thank you I have a mean comment on my channel a second ago and it got me discouraged  it's says that I shouldn't be filming anymore, filming is my passion and if he or she can't accept it then he/she could get a life, I don't care about what everyone says about me, I'll do me who gives him or her the right to do that?! Anyway Thank you so much! "
,"Hahaha I thought I got the highest amount of likely spam comment (32k) but you got 60k plus haha,, I review held for review comments, I found out that some of those comments are valid"

Dennis Bloodnok Channel,"Nick,

Many thanks for this video. Much appreciated. Very useful ideas / information for the likes of small YouTube creators such as myself."
Croissant,I always try to take the positive or constructive message from hate or sarcastic comments. But this can sometimes backfire :(
B AM1,"thanks for the advice--really needed this to deal with, and put a comment addressed to me in perspective."
Brough Built,Hey Nick. Thanks for the advice! Do you block many haters and trolls on your channel? It's my worst fear to have people hate on my efforts. Thanks again for your cool vids.
Mustie1,so pinning  their comment to the top and feeding them to the wolves is not a good idea l reckon.
Jonah Bennett,Great information Nick! 
Suzy Valentin Realtor,Excellent Advice Nick! Trolls and Haters are Losers. I don't give any of them my time or energy.
Mohsin Abro,"Hey My best teacher ️
U r doing a great job
keep it up"
Rupee Monk,"You are awesome Nick - your strategies are helping me immensely
Thanks from India <3"
Krishiv’s World,"One epic thing about your channel is that your voice is always very clear, and simple to understand. No one can ever miss a thing you say!"
Chris Mizo,"I honestly just laugh anymore Nick, you can't take them serious at all. Trolls are just got nothing to do but improve the algorithm  so no mater what you win"
FL FISHING CHANNEL,"Awesome video as always, i learned something new today, i normally dont get much hate but from time to time there is one idiot that has nothing better to do, i used to just deleted the comment from now on i will hide it from the channel thank you Nick "
Queen Habeeba,I get hate comments... Unfortunately I do react because I can't stand people like that. But the best thing to do is just ignore them and block em.
Nanto The Enigma,"Hello Everyone! When it comes to haters, ask yourself this question: ""Do haters pay my bills?"" No? Keep creating content, and keep being awesome."
Najhiah Hall,I really need to learn and hear from you because I find myself in the million and one arguments on YouTube over something stupid you know if I see something rude or mean I'll usually comment on it and people will go back and forth with me and I'll go back and forth with them and it'll turn into a full-blown argument that actually happened to me today. The crazy thing is I always get into an argument with people over something rude or mean that they have said and people end up telling me I'm the a*
A Perfectly Imperfect Family,"Haven’t had haters yet, but being a large family channel, I’m sure I will very soon! Thanks for the tips, because I had no idea you could do those things! I’ll definitely be using them!"
NateSavage,"Got you suggested from a fellow content creator , love the videos. Very informative.  Love it my guy. Appreciate what you do for us small channels"
Mehreena Ahmad,Also sometimes you may misinterpret something as an insult so u have to wait before you respond if u do. I do it a lot but its written language how do know what someone really means! 
CASUAL FRAGRANCES,"Great video idea and tips nick, this stuff great for YouTube content creators"
ZOILA EN UK,"Thanks Nick, this is really helpful."
Infinity Bucket,Thanks. You're right. I've gotten hate comments already but now I know it's not an attack on me. They're just jealous of me.
34 Thirty Four,"The lines are blurred when they said they just stated their ""opinions"" when it's just plain rude and hateful for no reason at all. I think most of these just feel attacked and lack the emotional intelligence to look at the dirt on their faces. I always watch feel good videos because I have chronic depression so when I scroll down to see the comments on those videos, on one of the positive comments, there is always these replies who are very negative. They just usually badger the replies section to force feed the others with their so called ""opinions"". Makes me lose hope with this world really. Strange thing was I always find them hidden in the replies of some positive comment."
O000O000O000,"So true, thanks for sharing this I had no idea you could block user comments from your channel - I haven't had this trouble on youtube yet, but on other social media platforms I get a lot of it - but you are totally right, thanks for sharing!"
Stanley Orchard,"I tell you what this is something that I am actually having a bit of a difficult time with. The comments on my channel are fine, but the comments that I get on Reddit from time to time have a tendency of really bothering me. And I am well aware of everything that you just said in this video, but i have the hardest time just letting it go on some of those comments. I feel the need to vent, or defend my position. I will literally wait a day or two to respond so that I can formulate a concise and levelheaded response. Of course that never goes anywhere. Sometimes I just don’t know how to just let it go."
"dr. kim sage, licensed psychologist",Nice mini therapy session advice Nick:) thank you!
LOCO NICOLE,Great video! Hope everyone reading this has an awesome day  never hate comments from me...positive vibes only
Ricky Chang,"I am new to internet and got hate from time to time and I am generally not good at dealing with hate since I am too sensitive

but thanks for the advice"
Hollow Haunts,"I got my first hate comment right now. This helps a lot, thanks Nick!"
DoodleMan149,"Hey Nick, I was wondering about something. Yesterday I looked into the Settings section of YouTube Studio and I found some things under Channel Settings. I found a section that looked almost like the tags section of a video when you upload one but all it had in there at first was ""Gaming,"" presumably because of my uploads. Any word on how those settings work or factor into views, subs, etc?"
Mermaid Alone,"I myself always see positiveness and beauty in everything and everyone! I think those who always see negativeness in everything they have problem! If I will be a youtuber I can accept logic critisicim of course as long as their intention is not reuining my selfcondidence, but not rudness and nonsense comments! Actually deading with these kind of people and the Rumors they may spread have been always my concern to not be a Youtuber! Thanks for the tips :)"
Geralynll,I spent hours crying because I was getting bullied by people on tiktok and a video making fun of me  for my teeth gap got 5 million views so I’m getting hella rude comments this video really helped me thank you 
James Macdonald,"Really helpful and compassionate video Nick,thank you.James The middle class Wrapper"
hypostein,"Lel luckily I found this video tonight and I just woke up with a few troll comments. I went to that channel, just to see whether that person was doing on the platform and she only made hate-videos and she only got dislikes and hate-comments back. Thanks to you I decided to hide her from the channel and not react on her videos. So great video! ️"
Bizantyjski Borsuk,Thanks Nick for an awesome advice

Mecha,"Since my channel has grew a lot more, hate comments are becoming so much more often lol, I usually just delete the comment.
Good thing I havent ran into someone continuesly trashing on my vids that I had to block them.
Thanks for the tips!"
Passion for food,"Never feed the trolls, they like it!"

"Faith, Food and Fitness","Really great advise not only for Youtube, can use these tips in life too!"
Thomas Hughes,"Great video, Nick, thank you! "
Andy's Awesome Adventures,"Thankfully, I don't get a lot of negative comments on my channel but when I do, I do one of two things: if the negative comment is legit and it's presented in a respectful way, I'll leave the comment up. If the comment is negative and it's insulting, I will not only delete the comment but if it's really insulting, I'll just block them from my channel. Goodbye haters!"
Ventriloquist Vance,You're a cool dude. I appreciate you sharing this video. I need a video like this when I occasionally deal with haters.
DeterminedZone,Thanks for this great advice  and your wonderful attitude 
Esplat,"Yeah I have a hater rn, I’m just having fun chatting stuff with them.They’re so butthurt over a little thing on a different video and they decided to harass me."
CJenda,"Excellent video Nick, thanks! "
FarahDoddle,"I got some hates after awhile my first video blown up,honestly just delete the comments and blocked them,or report.
If in 400 comment u had 3 hates comment or just troll,u still had 397 nice and lovely people who like ur contents,its nice to thinking that "
Chasing America,Thanks for the tips! I’m sure I’ll need them at some point. Awesome video!
Daniel Kolbin,"Nick Nimmin, I subscribed!  
I appreciate your work and everything and I can see a good dedicated channel when I see one. You are definitely the top 3 best YouTube helping channels."
Pizzles Tech Time,I can tell you right now this videos going viral great job Nick
Auntie A's Kitchen,I was also cheering when You said Earn it! I now love you more! Sound advice
Eric's Vegan Van,Looking forward to the day I have enough traffic where I have to start dealing with haters and trolls!
Kimchi Robotics,"Ignore them to avoid complications especially with monetization issues with your channel.
Then use their negativity as topics for your videos LOL"
Kirky Plays,"I can say this. Sometimes it can pay off in a positive way to react to their comments. I had someone just recently that said my intro was ""too cringy"" to watch the rest of the video and I gave them a simple response of ""well my content isn't for everyone and I am okay with that."" I don't think they expected a response, (or a response like that) and they weren't long backtracking and apologizing for what they said. "
Crazy4Games,"I actually got a lot of hateful comments from someone on YouTube back in 2013 just because I made a playthrough of a video game which he didn't like and he repeatedly ordered me to stop making it. Needless to say, his demands fell on deaf ears. Believe it or not, that same person has recently emerged from his cave to give my latest videos the same treatment, nearly ten years later. Pathetic, huh? :D"
Doug's Dharma,"Yep, I don't have many trolls on my channel but over a decade administering an online forum led me to realize how wise it was to put into practice the old Internet adage: DON'T FEED THE TROLLS."
Secrets of Texas,Thanks for this video. I'm currently having growing pains on my channel and dealing with this issue.
Channel 11: INFJ,Hi! You're totally right!  I got a hater comment once. She said my voice is annoying and she hated how I talk in my videos. I didn't mind. I understand she has issues with her own self. 99% of my subscribers are men though. Men are a bit nicer to me for some reason. It'd be nice to have female support though- 'annoying' voice or not 
Zoe Bull Kennel,Thank you for the advice sir 
Rupert CB,"Thank you, super helpful.  Been struggling lately with comments on my main channel."
Javad Ant,"Even from a business point of view, we only need a small fraction of internet users as our customer/client/subscriber to become a successful business. So why don't we just block the haters at first sight and give our attention to our supporters. I'm willingly looking for most effective blocking tools for my upcoming startup in advance. PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE"
Josephine De Smet,I really have a hard time telling if someone's being sarcastic or not and so I end up explaining myself e.g. to people who laugh at my tutorials because they're really basic (cause I target beginning and aspiring songwriters) idk if I should just ignore that
Sparklelight Sims,"This channel is so helpful, I love how you role played also"
The Lawn Mower,Good stuff. Thanks for the relevant content once again.

JayTehPro,"This made me feel more confident about my channel. Thanks, I just subscribed."
MASIve Thoughts,This is a great video because people care so much about what people think. If you think about it though the more comments and engagement you get the more Youtube recommends your videos? Even if it is negative...
The Hungry Hussey,"That’s great that the hide user hides them but they don’t know. I’ve hidden a few folks but in the back of my mind thought, “they’ll just make a new login and return”. Doubt they would if they don’t know. 

Great and informative!  Thanks Nick."
Stephanie Nelson,Great videos!!! Great advice!!! Thank you
SivPri,Great advise.. Your videos are really helpful. Thanks Nick

The Pearson Experience,"O man, I have had some Troll Haters they almost made me give up..... but I pushed through and learned how to deal with them... Thanks Nick "
Pinay mom's blogs,"In the beginning I get affected. There are people out there that are very judgemental about Filipina women marrying foreigners. But in the end, I just let them be. They don’t know me or my story (plus I just let my followers defend me haha). Nice topic as always! "
YourBoySuli,"Yes same, I always get hate, I am a new gamer and I am new to the gaming community and I posted some content and I got some hate saying that I suck at gaming and that no one would use my content! But I just used that to try to get better! Even though I am still not the best they made me even more confident and I try my best to get better."
Dai It Yourself,Thank you very much for the content! Feel much better after watching . I just started off my channel and yes got doomed by the 1st negative comment.....
DZ Legend,"Lol I just got my first negative comment after months of grinding and you upload this the same day. It wasn't super bad just someone saying they hit the dislike button. 
WHY ARE YOU TESTING ME NICK lol"
Rio Jo,Thank you Nick I did the blocked words and blocked some people.You  are awesome!
Dan Tirels,"Thanks for pointing out the difference between block & hide, wasn't sure but it makes sense now. Great advice."
Colorado Martini,"Exactly. Well said. YTers need to stop saying, it is interaction and that is a good thing. Sorry it is not a good thing. I don't need that kind of i interaction"
Blue Eyed Tech,I work as a behavioral technician for children and the trolls on YouTube are a classic example of attention seeking behavior. The best method is to ignore the negative behavior while showing attention to the positive in order to shape how they engage with others
Real Life Wave TV,Dislikes etc is part of youtube. The greatest creators get it
Mary Beth Dozier,Great advice especially for new channels.
Rose Honey Flower,For once a Youtube video that is very useful and not filled with rubbish. Pretty much a breath of fresh air to be honest. By the way do you know what kind of content that is very sensitive to make that a learning newbie should stay away from? My best guess relationship videos and religion.
Bj Waugh,I just ignore them..apparently my opinion matters more to them than theirs does to me
Yoga Bliss Dance,I like the split personality thing you've been doing lately!
ExclusiveGaming,The only reason why I hate haters is bc they make u feel like u don't matter and sometimes say things that can actually hurt u in real life bc they don't notice that bc their probably on their screen saying 'it doesn't matter I don't even know him/her in real life'
Xx Pastel xX,"I really needed this video, thank you!"
Austin Armory,As a small channel on YouTube… thank you for this wonderful advice!
How to Write Your PhD Thesis: Without Brain Damage,I agree with you.....they are just so weak that burn when see you intelligent. Sir you nicely and honourably said: they have problem and needs attention so no need to take it so personal ....
EYE LEVEL Awakening,Great advice Nick ....love the folks cheering in the living room....nice touch
,Another gem. Thanks Nick.
GAZDA,"Question though, with engagement really helping to push your channel further isn't it kinda helpful to have their comments? Like a necessary evil? "
- T o r i -,Thanks for making this video this helped a lot!
Mr. Cast Iron,Thanks Nick! I too have been dealing with the haters. I was deleting them but I will start blocking them too!

We only make videos on plants and we even get haters ️"
DarthShadie Lavellan,"I once had to deal with a guy who was nitpicking that my theory videos weren't valid because it was just speculation (it's for a video game). I made the mistake of answering and then he was incessant. At least he didn't do what an old acquaintance of mine did and say ""Stop making videos for YT."""
JoeDimesTV,"Hi Nick if you use the ""Hide user from channel"" feature to a user with alot of negative comments on your video would that decrease engagement?"
,"Handy to know :) things are still quite fresh on my channel so Im leaving the comment section as it is so I can get feedback on my videos, will definitely be implementing these tips in time though if things get outta hand,. thanks for all the great videos :)"
Mehreena Ahmad,I call negative commentators YouTube trolls but then sadly I become one of them. Most people understand what u mean and say but someone always like to ruffle your feathers. So I try my best to ignore the comments.  Bc you cant defeat the troll. But you can take yourself out of the troll web of destruction.
Tech 215,I just always get coy with them. Ill be like aww man thanks for the support!! That always drives them crazy but ive only had one.
RoadLessTraveled,Thank you! Great information!
Handberrydea,Haha I Love this video. Great message!
Longarms,"This video helped me a lot, thank you!"
Scott Hernandez,This video should be required viewing for YouTube creators but I thought this was for the viewers who just post comments and have people who just have to argue and get the last word.
Sia Yu,Nice one Nick! Notice you have a better sense of humour for the recent uploads
Songs From A Suitcase,"I really hope you can help with this question. My channel has started to grow fast ( absolute THANKS to your advice from these videos) and I’ve come to a new problem. I’ve been doing more vocal Coach reaction videos where I watch the video and then break down what the singer is doing correct and incorrectly. I’ve been teaching for over 14 years and I have a reputation in Los Angeles and San Francisco area, but this is a new venture with me going online. I’m getting a ton of negative comments and dislikes on my videos simply because people don’t like when I say what the singers are doing wrong or what they could improve on. So the question comes up “do I soften the way that I explain what the singers are doing wrong? Do I change and maybe not point out as many bad things? Or do I stick to my guns knowing that people who I want on my channel are people that want to improve their voice and the only way that happens is by pointing out what singers are doing incorrectly.”  it’s like this moral dilemma of do I stay true to myself and what I know as a vocal coach or do I change so that way more people like what I have to say?"
Angels E&V,Thank you I needed this
HOW TO MEDICATE,Haters will only make you bigger! Views are views 
🦇 Lady Ihcobob,"You can get some really bizarre replies out of them if you treat them nicely instead, never ceases to amaze me XD"
Tiffany So,Thank you so much for this video! It really is helpful ️
Striker Toast,Thanks man! I have some annoying “friends” who just like to mess with me. I decided to hide them from my channel. Do you know if there is a way to stop certain users from watching your videos?
DarKalligraph,"Haven't yet experienced a full on hater on my channel yet. The worst I've gotten is a few dislikes.

Also VideoLeap seems really interesting. I currently use Filmora, but it crashes quite frequently which deletes some of the work I've done. I'll be sure to check it out!"
The Standards of Geekness,Thank you for this one.
Farming Business Atbp,Great advise Sir.thank you so much.
Fusion,"I was cussed out for no apparent reason this morning, and it was really shocking... I guess I've been sheltered, because I've never been on the receiving end of such bile. I googled what YouTube does if I report them, and was really disappointed. They won't do anything unless they are inciting violence. That leaves a lot of room for abuse!"
Shannon Vlogs,It literally bothers me that people waste their lives leaving negativity on others’ channels. Like imagine the amazing lives they could be living if they weren’t doing this
Skully Let's Play,"Thank you! This is very handy to know. I didn't got any hate yet, but thanks"
João Gonçalves,Super useful advice here! 
SuperJasonOfficial,Thx! I have like around 3-4 haters on my channel but there is no reason why they hate me !

meinneuesleben24,Thanks for that vid. Really good explained.
Diehard Sports Card Collector,This is so true. There are some people with mental issues out there. Very sad that they have to troll to try to get attention
Crafty Yarn Owl with Darla,This is so helpful! I will link this to a video I'll be uploading later today! Thank you!
Carmen and Brian,"Over the last 5 years I've acquired a long list of hidden people.  I simply ignore/hide any trolls. I guess I was lucky when I started YouTube. I've done freelance work in the online gaming industry and if you think YouTube trolls are bad, online gamer trolls take it to a whole new level."
Official Reviews,When I first started my new channel(not this account) I got my first hate comment on my first video I uploaded. I did have 50 subscribers as a head start from close friends and some online people though. The person just said “he’s horrible” when someone complimented my video
Janet Beaufond,Oh really good.... I want to grow my Channel positively and now I know how to deal with it on Youtube.  Thanks again Nick....
Saudi Pinay Wife,Thanks for the advice. I just got my first troll comment an hour ago. I was about to reply to it but i thought twice and just reported the comment as spam. Now I know how to deal with haters better.
TexAveryRed7519,YouTube has definitely turned into a battlefield of opinions and arguments at this point
START GAME YT,"Thanks for teh advice!!

I wish someone told me the dont try to turn it into positivity I learned taht the hard way "
Jon Jon Games Official,"Everytime i hide the haters, i just laugh at them"
Bushcraft Savage,Excellent advice!
Ratty Star,Awesome video Nick. Loads of value to be had here. Why can we not report users for spam and block them from the same comment. Once we do one or the other the comment goes away. YouTube need to fix that I think
Molly Fashion Art,Amazing tips Nick thank you!! let me tey that videoleap as well for my video editing!! thumbs up!!
STAG FITNESS,Very entertaining :) Do swear words automatically get blocked ? Or do you have to manually add them . Wasn’t aware of this feature..... thanks
Ss Oo,Just curious - how does a troll know or find out if their comments are hidden?
Creeper Nation gaming,"I swear this guy is the best at youtube and helping other YouTubers he has helped me I’ve used he’s advice I feel better and growing slowly but what what I’m saying is thank you 
Keep up the great content I’m liking 
Again thank you"
jerrydahlgren74,Thanks for this great advice. I’ve yet to get any haters or trolls. But maybe some lucky day I will
Successful Convicts,Very inspirational!
RantJamz,"I just wanted to come back and say...i switched to my other accounts and seen you hadn't hidden me...thanks so much for not  doing so...i am a big fan and you have won me over after months of going back and forth on my loyalty here lol. Some people think i can be trollish sometimes, but i just like to leave real feedback...i suppose if they hide my channel or comment there isn't any reason to return to their channels...mad respect for being legit"
ElectroBlastLuigi,I really appreciate this video. I had this troll harassing me and my subscribers for as long as i can remember. I tried ignoring him and hide his comments but he just keeps making more accounts. :/
Jade Valentine,Hahahaha that b-roll was amazing Nick  thanks for this
The Block Farmer,Thanks man. I just got some hate on my YouTube short from 2 comments. I didn’t know you could hide the channel. Thank you
KatPlayzIt,Great info this helps alot thank you 
Ari B,"lol i loved the b-roll in this video i thought it was funny. and like i said in last video i like the skits because they change up the content to help with view duration, and i want to keep watching to see the next clip once will help your watch time. also these tips where helpful, the type of content i make gets alot of hate :)"
Mia G,"Thanks lol. I was in a music video that got quite a bit of views, and a few people were nitpicking my appearance, etc. This helped."
Dadvice TV - Kidney Health Coach,"Excellent topic.  I deal with these types of commenters daily across my channel (which is about being positive and improving your health to live better with kidney disease).  Sometimes their comments are so cruel and pure evil that you have to know their life isn't going the way the expected and this is one way of them lashing out.  I try to help some of them, and I have had success at getting them to see the positivity in life, but for most the best option is just to hide their comments.  Great tip on using the comment word filter to help block some of the spammers - I'm going to go set that up right now for some of the popular ""snake oil"" spams people post as cures for all that ails you."
IZthatKareem,"I'm so glad this channel exists, my channel is just now blowing up and well i'm sure ill get a hater anytime soon"
Angel Grey,Best video ever this helped me so much 
Falcon Summit,"There is a hate video currently on YouTube towards me and my friend. I tried to stand up for my friend as they were in an argument. Then they post a video running through the whole argument trying to prove that for the whole time of the argument they were better (literally bc they had more subs, I mean, I don't care xDD), (because they're insecure little twerps). The video has a lot of nasty insults in it but to be honest I can't really waste a braincell caring.  I'm kind of happy they made the video because they just wasted their time and that's less time for them to use it for their own problems. The video is still up to this day and is 1 year old. I find the humour in it and just move on. If you have similar experiences just remember that it is probably all down to them in their insecure little lives, and please don't waste any time thinking over it and just move on because you have better things to do in life than worry about people like them."
Switzertt,"I just need to deal with these people when I comment on something , sometimes there's some people disagree or just hates me on a toxic way . I need help with that"
Kasey Reid,"Brooo, in just 3 mins into this video I got so much value! Had no idea these options were available! THANK YOU!"

Jzombieboy08,If I get a hate comment I’m just trying to be as nice as I can to them
Cindy Kandie,"Thanks Nick
Always a dime"
GearGasms,I've converted some trolls to subs by giving it right back. Not the best overarching strategy but occasionally effective.
JB COLLECTIBLES,"I just dealt with a turd.. I mean a troll, great advice. Thank you!  :)"
Poccalilangel,I don't have haters yet but for sure in the near future i will. Lol. Thank you for this Nick
Da chicken,I just got hate from an enemy. Very great tutorial

Crazy Nerd,i need one that when you are targeted you dont lose friends when you are harassed or whatever. thats the biggest problem. i dont freak out till i start losing friends after all.
LewisWatsonVlogs,I used to react to haters.. Gives the viewers a laugh haha 
The D.A.N show,"Just started watching.  This is a great topic, I have a sports channel and made a list of Top 10 Kansas City Chiefs of all time and posted videos on Facebook.  I got so much negatively on this just hate, looking forward to seeing how you deal with this."
TransitAction 🇺🇦,Thank you for the tutorial.
Jedi Bunny,I just started learning to edit - it’s challenging but so rewarding. My subscribers have been so supportive and appreciative but I got a comment today that really stung given all the hard work I’ve been putting in. He said he couldn’t even watch my video because of the editing. 
Leathur Rokk,I had to delete 2 videos due to the backlash.I ultimately deleted then blocked the offending commenter.Funny how someone can turn from a fan to an enemy.People can and will turn on you if you say one thing they don;t like.Some people don;t get sarcasm or humour.So many people look for a reason to be offended.I learned so many lessons this week.Beware of locals if you are a Youtuber.The locals who discover you and your videos can really make a negative impact in your real world life!So i am thinking maybe its safer to be less autobiographical because enemies may smell blood and go after you.!And we YouTubers are public figures.I Never realized anonymity was a good thing til i lost it. Thanks for another awesome video Nick!!!!!
VeewithZee,Haha i love your sense of humor 
dEEA SliME,Never let haters pull you down.
kam,Thank you so much I was about to quit because of the haters

ÚŽASNÝ SVĚT ZÁHAD,great thanks for advice Nick
,I always find to just compliment a hater or just say something nice or just simply agree with them. They ALWAYS feel bad for lashing out and even subscribe HAHAH. Just be nice back it confuses them
,"I don't use the blocked words, but I do have a very long list of hidden users. Almost worried that YouTube may put a limit on me lol. Great vid as always bro"

They can only affect you if you choose to be affected."
DesignLife,"I was minutes ago almost crying about the haters I got, and I'm just at 12k. These days I felt like I should take a break from posting. I'm horrified what happens at 100k...haters are so MEAN!
I know it's abut them and you should not reply and it should not get to your head but it's so hard sometimes. "
Own Your Fitness (TM),"Hey Nick, I am a personal trainer and a empowerment coach. 1. what app do you recommend for me to edit simple but effective video tutorials and life coaching advise? I-movie? os is there another one? 2. since there are millions of trainers and life coaches on you tube already, is there still a point to making more videos? isn't your tube saturated?"
Soleers,"Thanks man, love you video. 

Yap you're right man, actually i didn't block anyone, but haters that keep blocking me, because they failed to make me angry."
Carving Fusion By : Jordy Johnson,"Thank u, needed to see this video, lots og good positive info"
The Spiritual Witch,Great advice  Thanks 
Unknown Mystery,"I really liked the editing on this video, it was different for you and in a good way.

I have a question, I have been posting a lot of dumb useless content in the past, I was new to YouTube and just wanted to practice but now I think due to no watch time, I think my videos are not being recommended should I start fresh with a new channel?"
Tube Techie,"Thanks Nick! We were just talking about that on Creator Chaos last night! Lol, maybe they knew you were going to drop this video."
Frys and Soso,"Thank you, all your videos are helping me. Thank you."
Deone SoBord,That crowd cheer scene was awesome! XD
Living Ironically in Europe,"But isn't removing coments counterintuitive if you're trying to grow? Due to them adding towards engagement, and thus helping in promotion of your video?"
Miggy ASMR & Bible Theatre,I like what you said concerning the people who are so negative could perhaps have something going on or had something happened to them that turns up as a reflection through how they treat or speak to others.  I oftentimes do consider what kind of day they are having and consider what it is that triggers others to be so negative toward others.  To me its a misguided channeling of negative energy.
Tarak Singh,"Thank You Sir, This video provides Valuable guidance to all small YouTubers like us, a must watch for all new YouTubers. #valueinvestindia"
A random person A random person,Just block them so they won't comment and post negative comments on their content

Don’t hate. Appreciate!"
Love of Pets,I needed this today but it's too late because I had a hater with death threats that I had to reply back and then blocked them. Thanks for the reminder to just ignore them.
Miggy ASMR & Bible Theatre,"True... No matter where you go, there will always be that 1 guy.  If it isn't constructive and plainly just downputting, those are the ones to ignore"
Ungal Kitchen,Thanks Nick and I like your thumbnail for this video
IMTRUSKILLZ,I had to stop commenting on one of my friends video because he let's trolls attack his subscribers. Even when I block them they can still reply to my comments on his video
,"Another great video Nick,  I'm still waiting on you and Dee to throw me a life jacket.  Tell Dee if I see his car, i'm gonna tow it.  Nothing personal,
just business. LOL"
Secret Journey,"Lol but I enjoy blocking. After they spend so much time writing it, then they find out they are blocked and can’t post"
Esperanto Variety Show,"I was being trolled by a guy and it was so goofy that I thought he was playing a character - so I played along. When he started doing it to other viewers, I asked him to stop and ended up deleting those comments - which apparently ticked him off and now he's ""boycotting"" my channel. (Don't do me any favors, right?) I'm glad he's apparently moved on, but I feel bad for interpreting his trolling as a joke and ""playing along"" while he wasn't really playing - because that means that my game possibly didn't feel like a game to him."
Investing with Aaron,Love your advice. Especially the sandwich  for sandwich  thing. ️
Oaklyn Streeter,Excellent video 
Oxford Superhost,"I use Youtube to share my personal eperience as a short term rental host in a small college town. But I have found since creating my channel that other hosts disagree with my hosting methods and have followed me around on all social media trying to silence me. It's always the same people trying to recruit other hosts from short term rental groups on Facebook. A year later their recruits get bored with ther party, but the original core of this group are living their lives to silence me. LOL. Policing Airbnb and other short term rental platforms is all they have."
Lots of Love Ariya,"Got my first hate comment today and before I’m gunna let it get to me, I’m pausing everything except this video"

valcaron,"Internet before smartphones, this advice was: ""Just troll them back, and/or grow thicker skin.""
Internet after smartphones, this advice is:  ""Just use this 'memory-hole' technique from George Orwell's novel, which will have no long-term societal consequences whatsoever when used in a widespread fashion, nosirree."""
NodaMixBeats,"This subject is not interesting for me at all, I don't get that much attention for the moment, but i'm gonna listen out of respect!
Nick, you're the man!"
dennis nelson,"If someone gives an unfavourable comment its not the end of the world,people have to endure far worse,just don't worry about it.If someone starts having a meltdown because they get a comment that's a bit negative;then that's  a bid odd.The whole  thing of having to treat people with kid gloves,in life you have to learn to take the  rough  with the smooth.Just grow a thicker skin."
Emlas Asmr,"Thank u for all the tips! I have been doing you tube for 4 weeks and really like it! And i get more acknowlige in every of your vid  so thanks!
/A You tube beginner"
Candy gamer_gacha UwU,Thanks alot this helps i just got my first hate comment so now i know how to deal whit it :)
Daniel Kolbin,"I get some ‘haters and trollers’ and do try to ignore them. We need to stay positive.
But there is one person who says he criticizes me, but still comes to talk in and watch my videos/streams, because he wants me to improve. I can appreciate that and am learning.
Also, it’s it okay if I use some of your clips from some videos to put in a video on how to get more subscribers that I am working on?"
life of lake,That 27 dislikes are haters
Rambling Recruiter,"Why would anyone want to troll you Nick? It's not like you give great info away for free, like everyday."
Elsie Lane Boutique,Someone told me my music was obnoxious...I have three videos and I just started last week! I expected it but not the first week! Haha. Thanks so much for this!
LukaBuckets,I’ve been getting a lot of hate recently and idk why. I just made a video and there calling my content bad. Almost all of them don’t post.
Suryashish 25,"Hi Nick
Arigato For this video

PR gaming,wow thanks for this video it helps a lot!
Ivan Liao,"Even after years of competitive gaming, I still can't get used to hate comments."
LawlessBaron,"First in best dressed good video Nick, this is an issue, thanks for touching on it"
bellekoa,"Thank you. I got so much hates comment on my video just bcs I don't show my face 

They call me too extra, so boring and so on 
Thank youuu for the video!!!"
Imran Shah - Vibe & Tribe,Love your little Donkey snippet - You are great teacher !
Lydia Great,"Haters just have too much time on their hands, huh? Nothing to do! Lol"
DIY Audio Guy,My channel is not big enough to draw in a lot of haters yet.  So far The comments have been overwhelmingly supportive and positive.  But I've had to deal with trolls in the past and I've learned that you have to focus on 1) people who actually give you useful and constructive feedback 2) The fans that love you.  Every ounce of energy that you put into a hater is an ounce of energy that you could use to make more quality content.
Allspark TV,"It's easier said than done, but people just need to grow a thick skin and not be bothered by what some random internet douche says or does. I've had people create entire web pages for the sole purpose of trying to slander me so it's pretty hard to get under my skin these days. Plus, I've found in the ""olden days"" of the internet from 2000-2010ish I got way more traffic and engagement when the drama squads would show up."
Big Heads Big Dreams,"The bigger we get, the more negativity we get on our channel. All we do is comment back something positive or delete it. Because, people are hateful. ️"
sarah taylor,"People shouldn't be able to treat each other like this ,there is people who litterally tear other people down and that's not okay.Think about how how many people have committed suicide from people who are tearing people down its probably the devil using those people as puppets to attack another person."
Luna0838 Clips,Really helpful tips. Thanks.
Epic Math Time,"""Envy is the religion of the mediocre. It comforts them, it soothes their worries, and finally it rots their souls, allowing them to justify their meanness and their greed until they believe these to be virtues. Such people are convinced that the doors of heaven will be opened only to poor wretches like themselves who go through life without leaving any trace but their threadbare attempts to belittle others and to exclude - and destroy if possible - those who, by the simple fact of their existence, show up their own poorness of spirit, mind, and guts. Blessed be the one at whom the fools bark, because his soul will never belong to them."""
HeatherPsyD,"I've been pretty lucky with comments so far, but I recently received my first messed up comment said that I should be thrown into feeding lions.  I was on safari, and the quality really wasn't great, but to suggest that I should be killed/die got to me.  I responded positively, received no response, then I just blocked that user from posting.  I can take constructive criticism, but inferring that someone should be harmed, joking or not, is just wrong to me.  Maybe I should have left it, but too late now.  I will handle future negative comments better.  Thanks for this video!!"
Cookin Mean Jean,Thanks for posting.  I have dealt with many trolls.  I have had someone follow me on different medias at once.
Diggin With Deej,Good video Nick.
YoKyandt,Thanks man you helped me a lot keep it up
Camoes Gamer,"Well, bad feedback is better than no feedback. Troll feedback can be good to share in social media! 
P.S - I want a troll just like the one in the video! "
Alicorn,"So, I currently have a spammer on my most popular video. Not a bot, but someone who's WAY too obsessed with the topic I'm discussing. They've left 20+ comments so far and the only reason I haven't taken action yet is because I'm worried they'll notice, make an alternate account, spam angry comments for blocking them and if I block that account, they'll just repeat the process. "
Dom AZ,"I didn't see yet a troll on my channel, just one negative comment. It's good to know about the ""hide"" and the  ""list""."
The Veggie Nerd,Good topic to cover for sure. Noticing your B roll and added cutaways. Nice nick.
,Someone called me white trash  so i did what you said and hid him from my channel  so thank you 
abandonvehicles,Thanks Nick .for the video from Charles and  Valerie .
Invader Plays,"There has been this extreme hater that I have he has been cyberstalking, and hating on me, and my content for around 2 years now. I have ignored him before, as well as blocking him.He has evaded blocking by making new youtube accounts, as well as taking my videos, and reposting them. It slowed down a lot since I made a video of me reading all of the comments he made. However I still get comments from him time to time even though I stopped posting on my channels due to working. I am just wondering if doing a video on the ones that use extreme hate is actually a good idea?"
Kelly Family,Thanks this really helps most of the time haters or bully’s had something bad happen I can say because when my dog died a while ago I became a hater but I stoped because it didn’t do anything about the death of my dog and it’s just life so I can say this is great advice and keep up the good work
Our2GirlBoat,My only problem with your videos is they don't have subtitles so I can continue to watch them while blow drying my hair.
Curries With Bumbi,Hahaha this video was funny too. Like how you said if you use the hide function the trolls will keep on typing without even knowing that they are hidden. That was hilarious the way you said. So funny  .
JayDeeMC,"As my channel grows, I've noticed that the number of trolls and haters has increased. It seems like it starts after 10,000 subscribers. Someone doesn't like that I get lots of views on gaming tutorial videos and claims that you can't grow a channel with tutorials. That's not real growth. Really? Evergreen content is a wonderful way to grow a channel. I have many videos that rank very well in search. I'd say that's a successful approach to growing. Anyway, I do just as you say. I hide them from my channel. And I don't have to see them, either. I know they're there clicking on thumbs down, but they're not polluting my comments with their negativity."
Step By Step Bass,Slacker Nick makes another appearance! Love that guy...
hurtighansen1,"I hate, haters lol and i love blocking them instantly. Only positive vibes is welkom. I will listen to critics, but in a well spoken way."
Lil Crafty Nook,"My issue (and I know this sounds crazy...) is guys who think this is a dating site!!!  The typical “Hi, how you doin, I’m from blah blah blah...” crap.  I just thank them for watching and go on.  But it’s still aggravating."
Heidi Orden,You’re are amazing 
Tugis Art Studio,"I love trolls. Without them, the internet would be boring."
Edward Sweeney,"Good advice, Nick.  Trolls are attention seekers.  They are jealous of content creators coz they couldn't create anything that would interest anyone.  99% of my subscribers are intelligent people, so when I get stupid trolls I just leave them there to make a fool of themselves."
Plan Zed,"Yet again more great advice... kinda needed to see this... I’m fairly new to YouTube content, posted about 6 videos last year but then nothin until about 2 weeks ago coz I been in hospital.. 
now, up until last weekend I had zero dislikes.. anyway some guy trolled me on Facebook and then dumped a load of dislikes on most of my videos in one night.. he even tells me he’s done it from different accounts multiple times ... i mean I got about 20 subs in the last couple of weeks of 2k views, a load of likes but now all these dislikes from this guy... obviously I blocked him on FB but I dunno his YouTube profile.., what can you do about something like this or do you just have to wear it?"
sevenmile,I don't understand why YouTube doesn't simply disable comments until a viewer ( with little or no content of their own) makes it through like 92% of a video.   I think it would cut the number of troll comments considerably.
My Pretty Everything,"This comes in handy, I got recently some nasty comments, it's always hard.."
crazycoollady1999,"I feel like I can't post a comment without being spammed with negative replies about me and nothing positive or neutral. For example, when I made a comment about my autism on a video about disabilities, I received many replies. All of them told me to stop seeking attention. When I said a video was educational, I was told I was ignorant, watched too much Rick & Morty (I have never watched Rick & Morty before), and could not solve 2 + 2. In one video that compared the 1999 SpongeBob intro to the 2016 SpongeBob intro, I stated my honest opinion on which intro I preferred. However, I was called the r-word, told I sucked for not perceiving the intros the same way, and even received replies saying, ""WTF"". This is just 1% of the many times people have expressed negative attitudes towards me without anything positive or neutral. At this point, you could just tell me not to post the comment. However, I am opinionated, and I try to cope with that trait by stating my honest thoughts in the comment section. I try to be  intelligent and well-spoken, but it is extremely difficult for me since I have developmental disabilities."
Days of French 'n' Swedish,"Does anyone else feel that the worst kind of comments are actually the ones that kind of subtley undermine your point, like, without saying, ""I disagree... "", they say something heaps black and white like for example, if I say an app is bad they are ""It's actually a good app, you are using it wrong."" or something, acting as if they know more about the thing that I have a freakin' YouTube channel about. It'd be like me telling Nick that he doesn't know how to get views and subs."
feel good ignite,Thank you Nick.
ventisvent !,I have 1 hater who literally only hates me cause I’m a gacha and that’s it. Like I’m not even a gacha heat I’m a gacha channel like before I did wanna be a animation channel but I could then only upload once a month and i like to post like daily or every 2 days plus I never finish animating so plz can you guys not hate all of the gacha community because most of them are trying to change the community or aren’t even heats if you find a gacha heat just report and block them then move  judging a whole community because of something s few people did even I hate gacha heats but just kinda hurts
ezhousehunts,"I find trolls amusing, most of the time."
JesslynnPlayz,"I do receive negative comments on my videos, I remove the bad comments and never take it personally."
DraculaTZ,Do not engage with them soldier
ZeroPancake9759,"Step 1: Block user
Step 2: Hide user
Step 3: Report user/comment
Step 4: be calm"
Blue kid,Honestly this might actually work because as soon as I make one video people start leaving negativity comments on my videos it doesn’t make any sense it’s like people who normally live in fire all day every day are a commenting on my videos
Arghya Das Sarkar,"Fun part....if someone comments like that on a particular video of mine, That boosts my video analytics lol "

Apple TechKnowLogies,"I’m very new to YouTube, been doing it for a month and already ran into haters. Don’t understand why they were hating on a small channel. I was deleting comments, but then I made a mistake by making a video calling them out. I have now deleted them videos calling the haters out and wish I had watched your advise on haters before."
MR BUTTONS OFF GRID ADVENTURE,So far I don't have any haters but I'm just starting out  on youtube and I'm sure they will find me eventually. Thank you for the advice.
Jon Vassa,Is there a way to tell if a comment is genuine vs a person just being a hater?
Toxic Wolf,Hi you've helped me with my channel and I love your channel I think you should have more subscribers
Breeze,Literally got one on tiktok when I uploaded a clip. For a small channel I instantly thought I must be doing something right if I’m getting hate comments now.
Salongirl Gardens,I was on a live and they were swatted. First time for me to see this happen and it was scary. Can you talk about this plz?
Schatz Kim,I just started my youtube channel..Thankyou alot for  this video.very Educative.
Lisa Monique Beauty,"I reply to them saying exactly what I want to say (always polite, but may point out they are rude) and then delete and block them.  I keep hoping they get the email notification with the what my reply and then they can’t respond back and I don't hear from them again."
Laman Digital,"When i see haters commenting.. i would just say "" oh, is that so?"" For the last time."
SK's CRAPPIE Catchn Adventures,I would like to see a reason submitted for a thumbs down required to hit a thumbs down or possibly the thumbs up and down in the viewer's comment so we can see who enjoys the content or who we could block from the channel......I don't get a lot of thumbs down but more than I want....Thanks for your time putting these vids together for us......
Neilxxgaming,Negative comments are. Crazy. ಥ‿ಥ

Walter Koren en Español,Very useful. Thank you very much
Ride along gang,Good advice thank you sir I will apply this
Maria Ackerman,I sometimes get a mean comment on a video created by another person saying that I should stop acting like I know that celebrity and I'm like whoa no need to be so mean I'm just a fan of this celebrity and love their work. I was like: Does this dude have anything better to do than just rudely say to a fan of a certain celebrity to stop supporting that celebrity?
BigPauly,9 trolls have given Nick the thumbs down. 
Aarantula,"I mean... Comments negative or positive, it aids engagement so I'm good either way."
bobby munyavi,Let the trolls come at me. Am not hiding! Trolls engage at 5 times the level of fans - They are gold
JayTehPro,At least the haters are giving you views 
,The worst is when other channel don’t even comment on our video anything about the video but leave their channel link ️
Its_Rick_James_Bi*ch,"Define hateful comments?
I want to know where you draw the line between constructive criticism/alternative viewpoints to what you consider hateful comments?"
SadCloudZ,I use some of the tips I fully recommend y'all so do some
Xavier Paolo Ledesma Mandreza,"Either way they can say the hell that they want. #Tragic

Wake up news - such features you mentioned no longer exist."
Inspiring Recipes - Fari Kitchen,I'm yet to get them.... I know they will definitely come but I'm learning to be ready for them
Transy's Dirty Secrets,"I feel all comments are helpful as are thumbs down. YouTube looks at channel activity, not whether the comments are positive or negative. They don't care if the thumbs are up or down. I always welcome s*** bags to my channel. Along with everybody else."
Arabian Flower (YH),"This is a really good video! If you see this comment, I could use your advice. What if someone is harassing me on the comment section on someone else's video? The block feature won't work for me and I can't disable the comments because it's not my video."
YT Magma-Playz,"I keep getting accused of stealing a video even though I didn’t, do you know how to fix this?"

Billion vlogs,Wow I love watching videos like this
Basst festival vlogs,Haters... sounds to me like extra comments
,I usually just like the negative comments just like I like the positive comments
Fenkingamer 09,3 months ago I got a comment saying “hey man your videos suck” I wasn’t offended or mad/sad. Because I filmed and uploaded that video in 4th grade and what is confusing I swear I unlisted that video more than 3 months ago. I am VERY VERY confused
𝐻𝑖,Can hate comments affect how your channel grows ( make it go down in subs or get more hate )
ANGEL GANG by Your Boi Whis,Imma save all the hate comments for later. Imma dunk on em in the most toxic way possible without age restricting it
Richard Yamato,Yeah haters give us views
