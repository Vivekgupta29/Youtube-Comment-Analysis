Virendra SINGH,"Good explanation but i think there's one more aspect of APIs you didn't mentioned is that.. API can be helpful when you are in any kind of development phase but you don't want to waste your time in some very basic coding, so you request/choose API providers for it. But i think it's just because you didn't wanted to go into deep and you wanted to keep your video simple. Please correct me if I'm wrong at any point."
